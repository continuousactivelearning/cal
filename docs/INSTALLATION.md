# Getting Started

The project uses Docker for development. Currently only the backend service is containerized. The frontend service will be containerized in the future.

## Frontend

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/cal.git
```
3. Change to the frontend directory.
```bash
cd cal/frontend-cal
```
4. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
5. Start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend service will be running on `localhost:3000`.

## Backend

1. Install Docker.
2. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/cal.git
```
3. Change to the backend directory.
```bash
cd cal/backend
```
4. Open the project in VS Code and click on the "Reopen in Container" button.

The backend service will be running on `localhost:8000`.
