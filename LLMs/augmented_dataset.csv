The ability to learn effectively from raw text is crucial to alleviating the dependence on supervised
learning in natural language processing (NLP). Most deep learning methods require substantial
amounts of manually labeled data, which restricts their applicability in many domains that suffer
from a dearth of annotated resources [61]. In these situations, models that can leverage linguistic
information from unlabeled data provide a valuable alternative to gathering more annotation, which
can be time-consuming and expensive. Further, even in cases where considerable supervision
is available, learning good representations in an unsupervised fashion can provide a significant
performance boost. The most compelling evidence for this so far has been the extensive use of pretrained word embeddings [10, 39, 42] to improve performance on a range of NLP tasks [8, 11, 26, 45].
Leveraging more than word-level information from unlabeled text, however, is challenging for two
main reasons. First, it is unclear what type of optimization objectives are most effective at learning
text representations that are useful for transfer. Recent research has looked at various objectives
such as language modeling [44], machine translation [38], and discourse coherence [22], with each
method outperforming the others on different tasks.1 Second, there is no consensus on the most
effective way to transfer these learned representations to the target task. Existing techniques involve
a combination of making task-specific changes to the model architecture [43, 44], using intricate
learning schemes [21] and adding auxiliary learning objectives [50]. These uncertainties have made
it difficult to develop effective semi-supervised learning approaches for language processing.

Semi-supervised learning for NLP Our work broadly falls under the category of semi-supervised
learning for natural language. This paradigm has attracted significant interest, with applications to
tasks like sequence labeling [24, 33, 57] or text classification [41, 70]. The earliest approaches used
unlabeled data to compute word-level or phrase-level statistics, which were then used as features in a
supervised model [33]. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated the benefits of using
word embeddings [11, 39, 42], which are trained on unlabeled corpora, to improve performance on a
variety of tasks [8, 11, 26, 45]. These approaches, however, mainly transfer word-level information,
whereas we aim to capture higher-level semantics.
Recent approaches have investigated learning and utilizing more than word-level semantics from
unlabeled data. Phrase-level or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained using an unlabeled
corpus, have been used to encode text into suitable vector representations for various target tasks [28,
32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31].
Unsupervised pre-training Unsupervised pre-training is a special case of semi-supervised learning
where the goal is to find a good initialization point instead of modifying the supervised learning
objective. Early works explored the use of the technique in image classification [20, 49, 63] and
regression tasks [3]. Subsequent research [15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization
scheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has
been used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classification [69], speech
recognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48].
The closest line of work to ours involves pre-training a neural network using a language modeling
objective and then fine-tuning it on a target task with supervision. Dai et al. [13] and Howard and
Ruder [21] follow this method to improve text classification. However, although the pre-training
phase helps capture some linguistic information, their usage of LSTM models restricts their prediction
ability to a short range. In contrast, our choice of transformer networks allows us to capture longerrange linguistic structure, as demonstrated in our experiments. Further, we also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model on a wider range of tasks including natural language inference, paraphrase
detection and story completion. Other approaches [43, 44, 38] use hidden representations from a pre-trained language or machine translation model as auxiliary features while training a supervised
model on the target task. This involves a substantial amount of new parameters for each separate
target task, whereas we require minimal changes to our model architecture during transfer.

Task-specific input transformations
For some tasks, like text classification, we can directly fine-tune our model as described above.
Certain other tasks, like question answering or textual entailment, have structured inputs such as
ordered sentence pairs, or triplets of document, question, and answers. Since our pre-trained model
was trained on contiguous sequences of text, we require some modifications to apply it to these tasks.
Previous work proposed learning task specific architectures on top of transferred representations [44].
Such an approach re-introduces a significant amount of task-specific customization and does not
use transfer learning for these additional architectural components. Instead, we use a traversal-style
approach [52], where we convert structured inputs into an ordered sequence that our pre-trained
model can process. These input transformations allow us to avoid making extensive changes to the
architecture across tasks. We provide a brief description of these input transformations below and
Figure 1 provides a visual illustration. All transformations include adding randomly initialized start
and end tokens (hsi, hei).
Textual entailment For entailment tasks, we concatenate the premise p and hypothesis h token
sequences, with a delimiter token ($) in between.
Similarity For similarity tasks, there is no inherent ordering of the two sentences being compared.
To reflect this, we modify the input sequence to contain both possible sentence orderings (with a
delimiter in between) and process each independently to produce two sequence representations h
m
l
which are added element-wise before being fed into the linear output layer.
Question Answering and Commonsense Reasoning For these tasks, we are given a context
document z, a question q, and a set of possible answers {ak}. We concatenate the document context
and question with each possible answer, adding a delimiter token in between to get [z; q; $; ak]. Each
of these sequences are processed independently with our model and then normalized via a softmax
layer to produce an output distribution over possible answers.

Model specifications Our model largely follows the original transformer work [62]. We trained a
12-layer decoder-only transformer with masked self-attention heads (768 dimensional states and 12
attention heads). For the position-wise feed-forward networks, we used 3072 dimensional inner states.
We used the Adam optimization scheme [27] with a max learning rate of 2.5e-4. The learning rate
was increased linearly from zero over the first 2000 updates and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule.
We train for 100 epochs on minibatches of 64 randomly sampled, contiguous sequences of 512 tokens.
Since layernorm [2] is used extensively throughout the model, a simple weight initialization of
N(0, 0.02) was sufficient. We used a bytepair encoding (BPE) vocabulary with 40,000 merges [53]
and residual, embedding, and attention dropouts with a rate of 0.1 for regularization. We also
employed a modified version of L2 regularization proposed in [37], with w = 0.01 on all non bias or
gain weights. For the activation function, we used the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) [18]. We
used learned position embeddings instead of the sinusoidal version proposed in the original work.
We use the ftfy library2
to clean the raw text in BooksCorpus, standardize some punctuation and
whitespace, and use the spaCy tokenizer.3
Fine-tuning details Unless specified, we reuse the hyperparameter settings from unsupervised
pre-training. We add dropout to the classifier with a rate of 0.1. For most tasks, we use a learning rate
of 6.25e-5 and a batchsize of 32. Our model finetunes quickly and 3 epochs of training was sufficient
for most cases. We use a linear learning rate decay schedule with warmup over 0.2% of training. ?
was set to 0.5.
4.2 Supervised fine-tuning
We perform experiments on a variety of supervised tasks including natural language inference,
question answering, semantic similarity, and text classification. Some of these tasks are available
as part of the recently released GLUE multi-task benchmark [64], which we make use of. Figure 1
provides an overview of all the tasks and datasets.

Natural Language Inference The task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as recognizing textual entailment, involves reading a pair of sentences and judging the relationship between
them from one of entailment, contradiction or neutral. Although there has been a lot of
recent interest [58, 35, 44], the task remains challenging due to the presence of a wide variety of
phenomena like lexical entailment, coreference, and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. We evaluate
on five datasets with diverse sources, including image captions (SNLI), transcribed speech, popular
fiction, and government reports (MNLI), Wikipedia articles (QNLI), science exams (SciTail) or news
articles (RTE).
Table 2 details various results on the different NLI tasks for our model and previous state-of-the-art
approaches. Our method significantly outperforms the baselines on four of the five datasets, achieving
absolute improvements of upto 1.5% on MNLI, 5% on SciTail, 5.8% on QNLI and 0.6% on SNLI
over the previous best results. This demonstrates our model’s ability to better reason over multiple
sentences, and handle aspects of linguistic ambiguity. On RTE, one of the smaller datasets we
evaluate on (2490 examples), we achieve an accuracy of 56%, which is below the 61.7% reported by a
multi-task biLSTM model. Given the strong performance of our approach on larger NLI datasets, it is
likely our model will benefit from multi-task training as well but we have not explored this currently.Question answering and commonsense reasoning Another task that requires aspects of single
and multi-sentence reasoning is question answering. We use the recently released RACE dataset [30],
consisting of English passages with associated questions from middle and high school exams. This
corpus has been shown to contain more reasoning type questions that other datasets like CNN [19] or
SQuaD [47], providing the perfect evaluation for our model which is trained to handle long-range
contexts. In addition, we evaluate on the Story Cloze Test [40], which involves selecting the correct
ending to multi-sentence stories from two options. On these tasks, our model again outperforms the
previous best results by significant margins - up to 8.9% on Story Cloze, and 5.7% overall on RACE.
This demonstrates the ability of our model to handle long-range contexts effectively.

Semantic Similarity Semantic similarity (or paraphrase detection) tasks involve predicting whether
two sentences are semantically equivalent or not. The challenges lie in recognizing rephrasing of
concepts, understanding negation, and handling syntactic ambiguity. We use three datasets for this
task – the Microsoft Paraphrase corpus (MRPC) [14] (collected from news sources), the Quora
Question Pairs (QQP) dataset [9], and the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark (STS-B) [6].
We obtain state-of-the-art results on two of the three semantic similarity tasks (Table 4) with a 1
point absolute gain on STS-B. The performance delta on QQP is significant, with a 4.2% absolute
improvement over Single-task BiLSTM + ELMo + Attn.
Classification Finally, we also evaluate on two different text classification tasks. The Corpus
of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) [65] contains expert judgements on whether a sentence is
grammatical or not, and tests the innate linguistic bias of trained models. The Stanford Sentiment
Treebank (SST-2) [54], on the other hand, is a standard binary classification task. Our model obtains
an score of 45.4 on CoLA, which is an especially big jump over the previous best result of 35.0,
showcasing the innate linguistic bias learned by our model. The model also achieves 91.3% accuracy
on SST-2, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art results. We also achieve an overall score of
72.8 on the GLUE benchmark, which is significantly better than the previous best of 68.9.

Analysis
Impact of number of layers transferred We observed the impact of transferring a variable number
of layers from unsupervised pre-training to the supervised target task. Figure 2(left) illustrates the
performance of our approach on MultiNLI and RACE as a function of the number of layers transferred.
We observe the standard result that transferring embeddings improves performance and that each
transformer layer provides further benefits up to 9% for full transfer on MultiNLI. This indicates that
each layer in the pre-trained model contains useful functionality for solving target tasks.
Figure 2: (left) Effect of transferring increasing number of layers from the pre-trained language
model on RACE and MultiNLI. (right) Plot showing the evolution of zero-shot performance on
different tasks as a function of LM pre-training updates. Performance per task is normalized between
a random guess baseline and the current state-of-the-art with a single model.
Zero-shot Behaviors We’d like to better understand why language model pre-training of transformers is effective. A hypothesis is that the underlying generative model learns to perform many of the
tasks we evaluate on in order to improve its language modeling capability and that the more structured

attentional memory of the transformer assists in transfer compared to LSTMs. We designed a series
of heuristic solutions that use the underlying generative model to perform tasks without supervised
finetuning. We visualize the effectiveness of these heuristic solutions over the course of generative
pre-training in Fig 2(right). We observe the performance of these heuristics is stable and steadily
increases over training suggesting that generative pretraining supports the learning of a wide variety
of task relevant functionality. We also observe the LSTM exhibits higher variance in its zero-shot
performance suggesting that the inductive bias of the Transformer architecture assists in transfer.
For CoLA (linguistic acceptability), examples are scored as the average token log-probability the
generative model assigns and predictions are made by thresholding. For SST-2 (sentiment analysis),
we append the token very to each example and restrict the language model’s output distribution to only
the words positive and negative and guess the token it assigns higher probability to as the prediction.
For RACE (question answering), we pick the answer the generative model assigns the highest average
token log-probability when conditioned on the document and question. For DPRD [46] (winograd
schemas), we replace the definite pronoun with the two possible referrents and predict the resolution
that the generative model assigns higher average token log-probability to the rest of the sequence
after the substitution.

Ablation studies We perform three different ablation studies (Table 5). First, we examine the
performance of our method without the auxiliary LM objective during fine-tuning. We observe that
the auxiliary objective helps on the NLI tasks and QQP. Overall, the trend suggests that larger datasets
benefit from the auxiliary objective but smaller datasets do not. Second, we analyze the effect of the
Transformer by comparing it with a single layer 2048 unit LSTM using the same framework. We
observe a 5.6 average score drop when using the LSTM instead of the Transformer. The LSTM only
outperforms the Transformer on one dataset – MRPC. Finally, we also compare with our transformer
architecture directly trained on supervised target tasks, without pre-training. We observe that the lack
of pre-training hurts performance across all the tasks, resulting in a 14.8% decrease compared to our
full model.
6 Conclusion
We introduced a framework for achieving strong natural language understanding with a single
task-agnostic model through generative pre-training and discriminative fine-tuning. By pre-training
on a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text our model acquires significant world
knowledge and ability to process long-range dependencies which are then successfully transferred to
solving discriminative tasks such as question answering, semantic similarity assessment, entailment
determination, and text classification, improving the state of the art on 9 of the 12 datasets we
study. Using unsupervised (pre-)training to boost performance on discriminative tasks has long
been an important goal of Machine Learning research. Our work suggests that achieving significant
performance gains is indeed possible, and offers hints as to what models (Transformers) and data sets
(text with long range dependencies) work best with this approach. We hope that this will help enable
new research into unsupervised learning, for both natural language understanding and other domains,
further improving our understanding of how and when unsupervised learning works

Abstract. We propose a prototype-based federated learning method
designed for embedding networks in classification or verification tasks.
Our focus is on scenarios where each client has data from a single class.
The main challenge is to develop an embedding network that can distinguish between different classes while adhering to privacy constraints.
Sharing true class prototypes with the server or other clients could potentially compromise sensitive information. To tackle this issue, we propose a proxy class prototype that will be shared among clients instead
of the true class prototype. Our approach generates proxy class prototypes by linearly combining them with their nearest neighbors. This
technique conceals the true class prototype while enabling clients to learn
discriminative embedding networks. We compare our method to alternative techniques, such as adding random Gaussian noise and using random
selection with cosine similarity constraints. Furthermore, we evaluate the
robustness of our approach against gradient inversion attacks and introduce a measure for prototype leakage. This measure quantifies the extent
of private information revealed when sharing the proposed proxy class
prototype. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence
properties of our approach. Our proposed method for federated learning
from scratch demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results on
three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2.

1 Introduction
The problem of training embedding networks has been widely studied due to
its applicability in various tasks, such as identification, verification, retrieval,
and clustering [3,30,32,36,37,40,43]. These networks are typically trained using
a loss function that simultaneously minimizes the distance between instance
embeddings belonging to the same class and maximizes the distance between
instance embeddings from different classes. In recent years, deep neural networks
trained on large datasets have been employed to obtain nonlinear embeddings
[7, 11, 14, 47]. However, collecting large and high-quality data for training deep
networks remains expensive for real-world applications [45, 46, 48].

One approach to address the data collection problem is to train the model
using a federated learning framework. In this framework, a global model is iteratively updated by aggregating local models without requiring direct access to
local data [2,20,22,29,35]. Specifically, we consider a scenario where each client
has access to data from only one target class and cannot share embeddings with
the server or other clients. In such a setting, it becomes challenging for each
client to learn an embedding network that discriminates different classes in the
embedding space due to the lack of information about other clients’ class prototypes. Consequently, the learned class prototypes might collapse into a single
embedding.
The problem of training embedding networks in a federated setup has been recently explored in various settings. Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS)
[42] learns an embedding network for multi-class classification in the federated
setup, where each client has access to only positive labels. In this method, client
embeddings are shared with the server, and a regularization term is applied to
increase pairwise distances between embeddings. However, the server is assumed
not to share client class prototypes with others. Unfortunately, adversaries with
access to the server may perform a model-inversion attack [10, 12, 18] to reconstruct inputs using a pretrained model and a target identity related to the class
prototype. Another recent approach is Federated User Verification (FedUV) [16],
which proposes to use predefined codewords guaranteeing a minimum distance
between class prototypes. Consequently, FedUV does not require sharing class
prototypes with the server. However, it does not take into account the similarity
of clients’ data during training embeddings.
To address this problem, we propose a federated learning framework in which
each client updates its local model with a contrastive learning loss to minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance. This approach requires sharing class prototypes with other clients, potentially exposing securitysensitive information. Instead, we introduce a method called FedHide, in which
clients share proxy class prototypes generated by linearly combining them with
their nearest neighbors to reduce the expose of security-sensitive information.
We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of FedHide when
dealing with non-convex objectives. Empirically, our approach reduces the exposure of sensitive embeddings to other users while maintaining discriminating
performance across datasets such as CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2
datasets.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where each client has access to data from
only one class. In such cases, we can naively apply one-class classification approaches, such as DeepSVDD (Deep Support Vector Data Description) [34] and
DROCC (Deep Robust One-Class Classification) [13]. In DeepSVDD, it trains an
embedding network by minimizing the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the
instance embeddings of the data. By minimizing the hypersphere’s volume, the
FedHide: Federated Learning by Hiding in the Neighbors 3
network extracts common factors of variation, aiming to closely map data points
to the center of the hypersphere. To prevent hypersphere collapse, DeepSVDD
uses neural networks without bias terms or bounded activation functions. Motivated by the observation that data from special classes lie on a low-dimensional
manifold, DROCC introduces a discriminative component. This component generates anomalous data, which are then used to train the embedding network.
However, the focus of this paper lies in finding a way to utilize other clients’
information without compromising privacy.
Federated learning (FL) is a method for training a model across distributed
edge (client) devices without sharing local data information.

In each round of
the learning process, the server broadcasts the current global model to selected
clients. After clients update their local models from the shared global model
using local data, these local models are uploaded to the server. Finally, the
server aggregates the local models to update the global model. A popular FL
algorithm is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) [29]. However, in our scenario where
each client has access to data from only one class, sharing the parameters of
the output layer, called a class prototype, with other clients is inappropriate.
The class prototype contains client-specific information and could be exploited
in a gradient inversion attack [12, 18]. Such an attack reconstructs an input by
minimizing the discrepancy between the gradient of a reconstructed input image
and the gradient uploaded from a client. It highlights that sharing gradients does
not guarantee client privacy within the federated learning framework. We will
demonstrate the robustness of our method against this attack.
There are FL methods that focus on solving problems where data are nonidentically distributed among clients. In FedProx [26], local updates are constrained by the L
2
-norm distance. SCAFFOLD [20] corrects local updates via
variance reduction. MOON [25] is a model-level contrastive FL method that
corrects local updates by maximizing the agreement of representation learned
by the current local model and the representation learned by the global model.
However, these methods do not specifically address our scenario of having a
single class per client, which represents an extremely non-iid case.
There are several works to handle the extremely non-iid case.
FedAwS [42] trains an embedding network for multi-class classification in the
federated setting. Each client has access to only positive data. The loss function
of FedAwS is based on a contrastive loss, aiming to minimize intra-class variance
while simultaneously maximizing inter-class variance. At each client, a similar
loss used in DeepSVDD is optimized to train a local model. Each client then
uploads its local model and a class prototype to the server. Instead of directly
sharing the class prototype with other clients, FedAwS optimizes a regularization term to spread out the class prototypes. However, FedAwS still requires
sharing class prototypes with the server, which may raise privacy concerns. FedFace [1] is proposed for collaborative learning of face recognition models based
on FedAwS. It shows good performance on face recognition benchmarks. However, it requires a well-pretrained model as an initial global model and still faces
privacy leakage issues. FedUV [16] aims to eliminate the requirement of sharing

class prototypes with the server in federated learning of user verification models.
The authors propose using predefined codewords of an error-correcting code as
class prototypes. This approach allows clients to collaboratively train user verification models without compromising privacy. However, FedUV has a limitation
to model the similarity between clients in the embedding space, as the codewords
are predefined without considering local data characteristics.
Our proposed method is related to prototype-based federated learning approaches. In FedProto [38], each client has a different embedding network and
does not share model parameters but only class prototypes. This approach
avoids compromising private information. In FedPCL [39], clients jointly learn
to fuse representations generated by multiple fixed pre-trained models using
a prototype-wise contrastive learning approach. FedNH [8] proposes using initial class prototypes uniformly distributed in the latent space and smoothly
infusing class information into these prototypes. However, they do not maintain global embedding networks, and deploying a global embedding network to
unseen clients is not feasible. ProtoFL [21] is a method designed to enhance
the representation power of a global model and reduce communication costs.
However, it requires an off-the-shelf model and dataset at the server.

We propose an FL framework in which clients update their local models using
a contrastive learning loss to minimize intra-class variance and simultaneously

represents the instance embeddings of local data, we share a proxy class prototype. This approach reduces the exposure of security-sensitive information and
allows us to learn an embedding network that discriminates between different

Image Classification. For image classification experiments, we utilize the
CIFAR-100 dataset [23], which comprises 60,000 32x32 color images across 100
classes. Our training setup involves 100 clients, each with 500 images from the
same class. The remaining 100 images per class are reserved for testing. During
training, we apply random horizontal flips and rotations for data augmentation.
10 H. Park and S. Yun
Our ResNet18-based embedding network is trained for 100,000 rounds, with
0.1 fraction of clients selected at each round. In the test phase, we calculate
classification accuracy using the global model on the test set. We assume that
the server has access to the clients’ test sets.
Speaker Verification. For speaker verification experiments, we utilize the
VoxCeleb1 dataset [31], which comprises over 100,000 utterances from 1,251
celebrities. Following the standard split, we employ 1,211 clients for training.
Each client possesses approximately 122 waveforms associated with the same
identity. The remaining 40 speakers are used to evaluate verification performance
in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) for 37,611 test pairs from the official test list.
During the training phase, we randomly crop a 2-second temporal segment from
each utterance to extract mel-scaled spectrograms using a Hamming window
of 25ms length and 10ms hop size. These 40-dimensional Mel filterbanks serve
as inputs to a speaker embedding network. Specifically, we use a modified Fast
ResNet-34 [6] for the speaker embedding network. The embedding network is
trained for 50,000 rounds, with 0.01 fraction of clients selected at each round.

Notably, we do not employ any data augmentation techniques in this experiment.
To calculate the EER during the test phase, we crop ten 3-second temporal
segments from each utterance pair and compute the average scores across all
segment pairs.
Face Verification. For face verification experiments, we utilize the VGGFace2 dataset [4], which comprises 3.31 million images of 9,131 identities. Following the standard split, we employ 8,631 clients for training. Each client possesses 365 images associated with the same identity. The remaining 500 users are
used to measure validation verification performance in terms of EER. We generated 338,430 test pairs to calculate EER, similar to the VoxCeleb1 evaluation.
During the training phase, we first detect faces using a pretrained FaceNet [36].
Finally, we use 64x64 resized face images as inputs to a face embedding network. Our training process involves a MobileFaceNet-based embedding network
trained for 400,000 rounds, where 0.001 fraction of clients are selected at each
round.
We compare our FedHide method with FedGN, FedCS, and FedAwS. Instead
of batch normalization (BN) [19], we employ group normalization (GN) [41] due
to observations that BN does not perform well in non-iid data settings for federated learning [17]. All models generate L
2
-normalized 512-dimensional embedding vectors. Clients are selected in a round-robin manner, and at each client,
the local model is updated with a single iteration. Across all datasets, we use
a minibatch size of 16, a negative loss weight of ? = 10, and a learning rate of
0.1 with the SGD optimizer. These hyperparameters were initially determined
through grid search for the FedAwS experiments. Our reported results represent
averages from 3 runs with different random seeds, achieved by adjusting hyperparameters. We conducted our experiments using PyTorch [33] and NVIDIA
RTX A5000 GPUs. For a single configuration using a GPU, the image classification, speaker verification, and face verification experiments take approximately
21 hours, 24 hours, and 80 hours, respectively.

Results
Figure 3 illustrates the experimental results of the proposed methods on the
CIFAR-100 dataset. In Figure 3a, 3b, and 3c, the horizontal axis represents the
FL round, while the vertical axis corresponds to classification accuracy. Generally, as the number of rounds increases, accuracy improves. Figure 3a displays the accuracy curves for FedGN with different hyperparameters, where
? ? {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. Performance improves as ? decreases. In Figure 3b,
we observe the accuracy curves for FedCS with varying hyperparameters, where
cos(?) ? {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. Performance improves with increasing cosine
similarities. Figure 3c shows the accuracy curves for FedHide with different hyperparameters, where ? ? {0.1, 0.01} and K ? {5, 10, 20}. ? = 0.1 shows faster
convergence than ? = 0.01. Additionally, lower K values result in faster convergence compared to higher values. Figure 3d presents a scatter plot for FedGN,
FedCS, FedHide, and FedAwS. The horizontal axis represents prototype leakage,
while the vertical axis represents accuracy at the last round. Results in the topleft corner indicate high accuracy and low prototype leakage. Notably, FedHide
methods effectively reduce prototype leakage while maintaining similar accuracy

In Table 2, we visualize reconstructed images using a gradient inversion attack [12] under different proxy prototype generation methods with varying hyperparameters for four CIFAR-100 samples. For each image sample, we reconstruct
the image from gradients obtained by the initial and trained ResNet-18 models
using our proposed loss function (Eq. 1). Additionally, we report the learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) score [18, 44], where lower values indicate greater privacy leakage. We utilized official PyTorch implementations for
image reconstruction from gradients 1 and LPIPS scoring 2
. Notably, reconstruction using gradients from an untrained model results in higher privacy leakage
(lower LPIPS) compared to reconstruction from the trained model, as trained
models generally yield low-magnitude gradients. Furthermore, we observe that the hyperparameters of proxy prototype generation methods such as ?, ?, ?, K
can effectively control the privacy leakage level.
Table 3 presents the cosine similarities between true class prototypes and
proxy class prototypes w¯
T
c wc in the last round of CIFAR-100 training. In the
FedGN case, as ? increases, the average cosine similarities decrease. In the FedCS
case, the cosine similarity used for generating proxy class prototypes aligns naturally with the average cosine similarities. In the FedHide case, ? = 0.1 shows
higher cosine similarities than ? = 0.01. Additionally, as K increases, the average
cosine similarities decrease as expected.
Figure 4 displays scatter plots for FedAwS, FedGN, FedCS, and FedHide
methods on the VoxCeleb1 and VGGFace2 datasets. The horizontal axis represents prototype leakage, while the vertical axis represents the EER at the last
round. Results in the bottom-left corner indicate both low EER and low prototype leakage. Notably, the FedHide method effectively reduces prototype leakage
while maintaining a similar EER to FedAwS. We use the same hyperparameters
as in the CIFAR-100 experiments, except for the value of K in the VGGFace2
dataset. Detailed numerical results are provided in Table 4.

This paper has a few limitations. First, the FedHide method necessitates empirical hyperparameter search. We plan to explore ways to determine the prototypedependent optimal number of nearest neighbors (K). Second, although we demonstrated reduced prototype leakage while maintaining accuracy empirically, we

did not provide a privacy guarantee analysis. Lastly, the proposed method could
be vulnerable to adaptive attackers who continuously monitor the communication channel and attempt to recover the true prototype by solving linear inverse
problems [24].
5 Conclusion
We proposed FedHide, a federated learning method of embedding networks in
classification and verification tasks. In this approach, each client has access to
data from only one class and cannot share a class prototype, which represents
local private data, with the server or other clients. In the FedHide framework,
clients update their local models using a contrastive learning loss to minimize
intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance. They achieved this by
utilizing proxy class prototypes that can be shared among other clients. These
proxy class prototypes are generated by linearly combining them with their nearest neighbors. In our comparative experiments, FedHide demonstrated the best
performance in terms of low prototype leakage while maintaining high accuracy
or low EER. Additionally, we provided a theoretical analysis of the convergence
rate of FedHide when dealing with non-convex objectives.

Abstract. Advances in rendering have led to tremendous growth in texture assets, including resolution, complexity, and novel textures components, but this growth in data volume has not been matched by advances
in its compression. Meanwhile Neural Image Compression (NIC) has advanced significantly and shown promising results, but the proposed methods cannot be directly adapted to neural texture compression. First, texture compression requires on-demand and real-time decoding with random access during parallel rendering (e.g. block texture decompression
on GPUs). Additionally, NIC does not support multi-resolution reconstruction (mip-levels), nor does it have the ability to efficiently jointly
compress different sets of texture channels. In this work, we introduce
a novel approach to texture set compression that integrates traditional
GPU texture representation and NIC techniques, designed to enable random access and support many-channel texture sets. To achieve this goal,
we propose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that employs a convolutional encoder to capture detailed information in a bottleneck-latent
space, and at decoder side we utilize a fully connected network, whose inputs are sampled latent features plus positional information, for a given
texture coordinate and mip level. This latent data is defined to enable
simplified access to multi-resolution data by simply changing the scanning strides. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides much better results than conventional texture compression, and
significant improvement over the latest method using neural networks.

object’s surface appearance should change according to lighting and viewing position [18,35]. Texturing endows surfaces with realistic characteristics like roughness, smoothness, reflectivity, and intricate patterns, allowing faithful replication
of various materials such as wood, metal, fabric, glass, or concrete. This significantly contributes to the overall realism of rendered scenes. However, achieving
this level of realism necessitates vast amounts of data which can impact download
times, rendering speed, and local storage. While the amount of data has been
reduced with some widely used texture compression methods, these are comparatively limited and inefficient [41]. The development of better compression
methods has been very slow due to several technical difficulties.
In computer graphics, textures often appear magnified and can have large
sizes with multiple components. These are organized in a multi-resolution mipmap
pyramid, which plays a crucial role in texture resampling. Mipmaps can be visualized as an image pyramid for efficient texture filtering, where each mip level
represents a filtered version of the texture, corresponding to a specific image
pixel-to-texture pixel ratio. However, only a small fraction of this data is needed
for a specific scene view, and therefore efficient texture compression methods are
essential to decompress only the required components. This compression must
also support asynchronous parallelized execution, allowing each rendering thread
to independently access the necessary values for its tasks at the required position
and resolution.
This requirement eliminates several of the most efficient techniques used for
compressing 2D images and videos, that exploit wide scale dependencies, statistical consistency, and serialized entropy coding, and that consequently cannot
be independently decompressed.
Another complication is that rendering is fully programmable, enabling the
creation of an increasing variety of texture components. Thus, the design of

methods that can optimally compress all new texture types cannot be done
effectively manually, but can be automated via learning-based techniques.
Neural network-based compression methods have been proposed and demonstrated to be competitive with conventional methods for images and video. However, these codecs are not designed for, nor can they be easily modified to support
random access and other rendering requirements. Unlike digital image compression, which focuses on compressing an entire image at a fixed resolution and
typically handles a fixed number of color channels (e.g., 3 channels for RGB or
YUV), texture compression must exploit multiple levels of redundancy in the
texture components. This paper addresses these complexities by proposing new
learning-based methods and neural-network architectures specifically designed
for texture compression and rendering.
2 Motivation
Conventional texture compression achieves random access by employing blockwise vector quantization. These techniques often leverage both spatial and crosschannel correlations. However, their limitation lies in the fact that they can only
compress textures with up to “four channels”. In contrast, modern renderers commonly utilize a broader range of material properties, including color channels as
well as other channels for normal maps, height maps, ambient occlusion, glossiness, roughness, and other information related to the Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Function (BRDF).
These channels exhibit significant correlation within the texture set. This correlation arises from a combination of factors, including physical material properties, geometric features, and artistic layering during material authoring [15].
For instance, consider Figure 3, where a texture set related to a brick wall pattern includes color channels as well as other channels for normal map, combined
ambient occlusion (ao) and roughness map, and displacement map.
Furthermore, in computer graphics, for efficient rendering textures are stored
at different resolutions, commonly referred to as mipmaps. As shown by [44] there
are significant redundancies at different scales.
In their pioneering work, Vaidyanathan et al. [41], introduced a novel neural
texture compression scheme. Their approach exploits spatial redundancies across
all channels of a texture set and across different mip levels. They achieved this by
compressing the entire texture set, including all channels and mip levels simultaneously. Their autodecoder framework [31] utilizes a pair of feature pyramids,
referred to as Girds, to represent the texture set throughout all mip levels. Each
pyramid level is responsible for reconstructing texels at one or more mip levels,
and features stored at a particular pyramid level can be shared across multiple
mip levels. This innovative method significantly advances texture compression
efficiency and quality in texture representation.
In our analysis, we identified redundancy within the feature pyramids, which
adversely affected compression performance. Particularly, as texture resolution
increased, this redundancy became more pronounced

In our investigation (Figure 2), we have observed substantial similarity across
various levels of the feature pyramids, which suggests the presence of redundant
data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative neural texture compression
method based on an asymmetric autoencoder framework. The key contributions
of our approach are as follows (see Figure 1a):
1. Asymmetric autoencoder framework: Our “Global transformer” processes
a texture set and generates representations that capture spatial-channelresolution redundancy. The “texture synthesizer” then samples from these
representations to reconstruct texels at specific positions and mip levels.
2. Grid Constructor: The global transformer exclusively operates on the texture
set at the highest resolution (mip level 0) and maps it into a pair of singleresolution representations. These pair of representations capture high and
low frequency features of the texture set and serve as the representation
across all mip levels.
3. Grid sampler: To facilitate texel reconstruction from different mip levels, we
sample the features stored in the representations using varying strides.
By leveraging redundancies across pixels, different channels and mip levels, our
method enhances texture compression while maintaining quality.

3.1 Conventional Texture Compression
Texture compression serves as a specialized technique for compressing texture
maps within 3D computer graphics rendering systems. Unlike conventional image compression algorithms, which are designed for general images, texture compression algorithms specifically target random access scenarios [6]. The primary
challenge lies in allowing rapid random access to decompressed texture data,
given the unpredictable order in which a renderer accesses texels. Notably, texture compression tolerates asymmetric encoding and decoding speeds, as the
encoding process typically occurs only once during application authoring [6].
Most conventional texture compression algorithms involve lossy vector quantization of small fixed-size blocks of pixels into equally sized blocks of coding bits.
These algorithms often include additional pre-processing and post-processing
steps. For instance, Block Truncation Coding (BTC) [8] exemplifies a straightforward approach within this family of methods. Practical texture compression
systems, such as S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) [43], PowerVR Texture Compression (PVRTC) [10], Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC) [36], and Adaptive
Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) [30], have been developed to address the
growing texture storage demands in real-time applications. Interestingly, these
systems still rely on block-based texture compression techniques initially introduced in the late 1980s for handling RGB data. The primary limitation lies in
the fact that existing systems can only compress textures with up to four color
channels (e.g., RGB or RGBA). Additionally, they compress each mip level separately. Consequently, they cannot fully capture correlations across all channels
of a texture set and its mip levels.
3.2 Neural Compression
Neural compression leverages the neural networks to compress data and has attracted great attention [1–4, 12–14, 16, 17, 22–28, 32–34, 39, 40]. Among them,
neural image compression (NIC) [2–4, 12, 14, 26–28, 39, 40] performance is very
competitive and some of them have surpassed conventional image compression.
However, we can not apply them to the graphic texture compression directly due
to the following limitations. Firstly, texture compression requires to randomaccess, which enabling to decompress only certain texels or texel blocks from
a whole texture. Secondly, NIC methods often leverage entropy coding to compress the latent features, which is hardly possible for random-access due to the
nature of entropy coding as a variable length coding method. Thirdly, neural
image compression methods normally are designed for the RGB images, which
contains three channels. In contrast, graphic textures often contain various channels for different materials, including albedo, normal, roughness and so on. For
instance, in one single scenario containing a bottle of water, the materials of the
bottle might contain more channels than the materials of the label attached to
the bottle. It requires to develop a compression method working for materials

with various channels. Lastly, neural image compression typically only needs to
reconstruct the one single image at the input image resolution, while texture
compression has to reconstruct texture with different resolutions (mip levels).
3.3 Implicit Neural Representation
In earlier research, [9, 37] explored RGB image compression by employing a
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This MLP mapped pixel locations to RGB values and transmitted the MLP weights as a code for the Implicit Neural Representation (INR) of the image. However, overfitting such MLPs—referred to as
implicit neural representations—proved challenging due to the high-frequency
information inherent in natural images. [9, 37] demonstrated that this overfitting issue could be improved by incorporating sinusoidal encodings and activations. While [9] reported a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) below 30dB, [37]
achieved higher PSNR by leveraging meta-learning, specifically Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning [11], for initialization. However, this meta-learning approach is
not directly applicable to texture compression, where a texture set may include
information beyond color, and the number of channels can vary. Despite enabling
random access, INR-based compression fell short in achieving high PSNR. Subsequent research by [29, 38] addressed this limitation by introducing grid-based
neural representations. These grid-based representations form the foundation for
the first neural texture compression, as proposed by [41].
3.4 Neural Texture Compression
In their groundbreaking work, Vaidyanathan et al. [41] introduced the Neural
Texture Compression (NTC) method, which fulfills random-access requirements.
The NTC scheme leverages spatial redundancies across different mip levels and
channels within a texture set. Their approach involves storing essential texel
features for decompression in a pair of feature pyramids. These pyramids are
optimized to minimize reconstruction loss while adhering to a specific bit rate
determined by quantization levels. However, despite their effectiveness, there remains some redundancy between feature pyramid levels, impacting compression
performance

Method
To handle the rendering requirements of texture compression, we utilized an
asymmetric autoencoder framework to compress texture set T. Texture set T is
represented by a tensor of size c × h × w, where c indicates the total number of
channels of the textures in the texture set, h and w corresponds to the height and
width of the textures, respectively. Here we assume each texture in a texture set
has the same width and height. Similar to [41], we do not make any assumptions
about the channel count or the order of textures in the texture set. For example, the normals or diffuse, albedo could be mapped to any channels without having any impact on compression. This is because we train a compression model
specifically for a given texture set.
Our neural texture compression consists of four main parts: (1) Global transformer E, (2) Grid Constructors C0, C1, (3) Grid Samplers S0, S1 and (4) Texture
synthesizer D. In the following we elaborate each part. Figure 4 illustrate the
framework of our neural texture compression.
5.1 Experimental setups
Datasets We commence by assessing the performance of various texture compression techniques across diverse texture sets. Our selection comprises seven
distinct materials, each associated with texture sets that exhibit varying channel
counts. These texture sets boast a resolution of 2048×2048 texels, with channel
counts spanning from 5 to 12. Notably, these public texture sets partially align
with those employed in a previous study by [41], as their complete dataset is
not publicly available. These publicly accessible texture sets are sourced from
ambientCG1 and PolyHaven2
.

In each subsequent stage, we increase the crop-size Cs by a factor of 2 until
the texture synthesizer is capable of reconstructing the complete chain of mip
levels. Our training setup employs a batch size of 4 and a learning rate (LR) of
10?4
, which we decrease by a factor of 2 as we increment the crop size at each
stage. At the final stage, we train the model for 20, 000 steps with a LR of 10?5
.
During the earlier stages, we follow the approach proposed by [5] to replace quantization with additive uniform noise within the range
?
1
2Bi+1 ,
1
2Bi+1 
.
However, in the final stage, we explicitly quantize the feature values using the
straight-through estimator (STE) introduced by [39]. We enforce a fixed quantization rate of Bi = 4, i = 0, 1 for all feature values in the grid-pair Gi
, optimizing solely for distortion. Across all stages, we employ the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) as the distortion metric for calculating the loss, and we use the Adam
optimizer [20]. Table 1 shows the training stages for a 2048 × 2048 texture set
and a mip level range of m = 0, . . . , 9.
Evaluation metrics We measure the rate in bits-per-pixel-per-channel (BPPC),
considering that the total number of channels varies across different texture sets.
The BPPC encompasses both the bits required to allocate the grid-pair and the
parameters specific to the text synthesizer, which is trained uniquely for each
texture set. Throughout our evaluation, we consistently set Bi = 4 to store each
grid-pair Gi (where i = 0, 1). The total number of bits needed to store a gridpair is given by cgi
·h·w
32 . Here, cgi
represents the number of channels of the grid
Gi
, and h × w denotes the resolution of the texture set at the zero mip level.
Additionally, the total number of bits required to store the texture synthesizer
corresponds to its total number of parameters, multiplied by the parameter precision. To control the bit rate, we manipulate the number of channels in the
grid-pair (cgi
) and adjust the hidden layers in both the global transformer and
texture synthesize
.

To summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we also report the
Bjøntegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) [7]. This represents the average bitrate saving
for a fixed quality when compared to a reference compression method.
Compared methods In our comparative evaluation, we assessed our compression method alongside NTC (as proposed by [41]). Since the NTC source code
was not publicly available at the time of writing this paper, we re-implemented
their approach and conducted evaluations on the same dataset as ours. Notably,
our re-implementation closely aligns with the performance reported in [41], with
the minor discrepancy arising from our use of a subset of publicly available
texture sets.
Additionally, we compared our method’s performance against ASTC3
. Following the same settings as outlined in [41], we utilized the ‘-exhaustive’ flag
to achieve the best quality. Specifically, we employed the two most aggressive
variants of ASTC, which compressed 12 × 12, 10 × 10, 8 × 8 and 6 × 6 tiles.
5.2 Results
Rate-Distortion performance Figure 5 illustrates the rate-distortion curve
in terms of PSNR for our compression method, our re-implementation of NTC
(as described in [41]), and ASTC. These methods were evaluated on the same
dataset, including the NTC results reported in [41].
As depicted in Figure 5, our compression method consistently outperforms
both NTC and ASTC across all bit ranges. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant BD-rate improvement of 40.8% compared to NTC (our reimplementation).
Although our compression is not optimized for SSIM [42], we have included
in Figure 5. Similarly, our method consistently outperforms the other methods.

Qualitative results Figure 3d shows original and reconstructed texture set of
our method, referred to as Convolutional Neural Texture Compression (CNTC),
versus NTC [41]. The compression profiles corresponds to the lowest BPPC cases
shown in Figure 5.
5.3 Analysis
Effect of interpolation in grid-samplers Figure 6 displays the 4th channel of
the grid-pair (G0, G1) alongside their corresponding absolute Fourier transforms.
In Figure 6d, the Fourier transform of G1 exhibits a concentration around
the center (low-frequency components). This design choice aims to capture more
abstract features. Conversely, Figure 6b showcases that G0 is adept at capturing
higher frequency components and providing more detailed information.
Effect of Global transformer As illustrated in Figure 7a in order to demonstrate the impact of the Global transformer and Grid constructors, we removed
them from the compression framework and directly trained grid-pairs as model
parameters using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), following the approach
in [41]. However, due to the grid-pair being 8 times smaller (both horizontally
and vertically) than the texture set T, the grid-pair learned via SGD struggles to capture high-frequency information. As depicted in Figure 8a, the PSNR of the
model without a global transformer is significantly lower than that of the model
with one. Increasing the bit-rate does not substantially improve the situation.

Effect of synthesizer depth In order to investigate the impact of the depth
of the texture synthesizer, we conducted an ablation study. We systematically reduced the number of residual blocks from the original design (which had four
blocks) down to zero block. This resulted in a synthesizer that includes only
two MLP layers. Figure 8c illustrates the outcomes of this study. When using
only a single residual layer, the BBPC decreased by 8%. However, there was
a trade-off: the PSNR performance dropped by 11%. Interestingly, when we
completely removed the residual block, the performance suffered significantly.
This highlights the critical importance of the residual block in our design.
5.4 Discussion and Future work
This evaluation has underscored the efficacy of our approach, which leverages
multiple levels of redundancy in texture compression. This approach yields a significant advantage over competing methods. However, we acknowledge certain
limitations that we aim to address in future work. Firstly, our current implementation of texture synthesis utilizes a pair of single resolution grids. This
necessitates an interpolation step to access in-between mip levels. This rudimentary method may lead to aliasing, as also noted in [41]. Moving forward, we plan
to investigate a data-driven interpolation method. This approach would adaptively address interpolation while preserving overall consistency across different
mip levels. Secondly, the success of our method is closely tied to the robustness
of our global transformation, which exploits multi-dimensional spatial-channelresolution redundancy. In future work, we aim to enhance this by exploring more
representative and powerful architectures. These would better capture the multilevel redundancy inherent in the texture, potentially through the use of attention
mechanisms, as suggested by [45].

Conclusion
This paper introduces an innovative and effective method to tackle the challenge of automating the development of texture compression in photorealistic
rendering. The goal is to store textures efficiently, enabling random access and
rendering at various resolutions, using learning methods to support all types
of texture components. Our key insight lies in analyzing the redundancy inherent in the problem. Specifically, we identify multiple levels of redundancy:
among different channels of a texture, across various resolutions of the same
texture, and within individual pixels within each channel. Leveraging these observations, we propose novel techniques for texture compression. Our method
begins with a global transformation step that extracts a set of hidden global features 4.1. These features are then transformed into dual-bank features through
a grid construction process. This process includes a dual-bank projection and
an asymmetric quantization step, which adaptively separates the global features
into two groups of different frequencies based on the global texture information 4.2. Next, our grid-sampler samples these features corresponding to each
encoding input position 4.3. Finally, we employ a texture synthesis to reconstruct these features back into the pixel domain 4.4. Our results demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing
all conventional texture compression methods. Furthermore, it often outperforms
competitive neural compression methods [41].

Abstract
The scarcity of ground-truth labels poses one major
challenge in developing optical flow estimation models that
are both generalizable and robust. While current methods
rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit
the rich information available in labeled video sequences.
We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. Utilizing a forward warping approach, OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student
style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the
teacher model’s predicted optical flow, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The
teacher’s weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student. Our evaluations demonstrate
perceptually superior interpolation quality and enhanced
optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as
Sintel and KITTI.
1. Introduction
Optical flow estimation and Video Frame Interpolation
(VFI) share a complementary relationship. Accurate optical
flow contributes significantly to various downstream tasks
such as video compression [26, 44], video denoising and
blur removal [3, 46, 49], action recognition [5, 22], and VFI
stands as one of these applications. Pixel-level correspondence by optical flow enables estimating pixel-level movement and generating intermediate frames (or inter-frames).
While utilizing flow-based methods is a common practice in
VFI [12, 20, 23, 27], leveraging inter-frames to train optical
flow models is relatively less explored.

While the scarcity of ground-truth data has long been
a critical challenge in learning-based optical flow estimation [8, 11, 13, 34, 38, 41], there has been little attention into leveraging Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) to augment the training of optical flow networks. State-of-the-art
VFI models predominantly employ deep networks trained
to interpolate the exact middle frame between two consecutive time steps within a video sequence, which restricts
their capability to generate frames at other intermediate
time instances thus hampering their ability to produce optical flows between existing and intermediate frames reliably.
Besides, these models lack generalizability across new domains without necessitating finetuning or retraining. These
limitations hinder the potential use of existing VFI models, To address data scarcity in optical flow training: data
augmentation [18, 39], data generation [8, 10, 39], and
semi-supervised learning [10, 14, 17, 18] have been explored. Most of the current data augmentation methods
prioritize modifying the existing frames, e.g., [18], as illustrated in Fig. 1 (top). Notably, RealFlow[10] stands out
by synthesizing a new second frame via forward warping.
Given a pair of frames and the model’s prediction, the original first and second frames form a new training pair, used
to update model weights. Model prediction, frame synthesis, and model update are iterated in an ExpectationMaximization (EM) framework, as depicted in Fig. 1 (middle). While it is possible to use forward warping to interpolate frames, RealFlow focuses only on making the model’s
prediction consistent with frame synthesis. Moreover, the
EM steps significantly increase the training workload.

In this paper, we introduce OCAI, a novel approach
for training optical flow networks within a semi-supervised
framework using readily available unlabeled pairs. Our
method leverages video frames and flow interpolation to
achieve this goal. OCAI implements an occlusion-aware
forward warping technique, facilitating the interpolation of
both inter-frames and intermediate flows, and can effectively tackle pixel value ambiguities during the warping
process without needing any depth information and can
do confidence-aware estimation of missing values utilizing
forward-backward consistency. Our algorithm can perform
interpolation at any intermediate time step, thus offering a
broad diversity of data and motion ranges essential for training optical flow models. Our innovative teacher-student
style semi-supervised learning scheme utilizes these resulting inter-frames to train optical flow networks effectively.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose a novel approach, OCAI, that tackles the
data scarcity challenge in training optical flow models, by exploiting useful, hidden information in existing
videos. Specifically, we interpolating frames and flows
to generate supplementary data, and use them in a semisupervised learning framework.
• To do this, we propose a new, effective video interpolation method that derives occlusion information to address ambiguous pixels and fill in holes by exploiting optical flow consistency. Our algorithm flexibly generates
high-quality intermediate frames and reliable intermediate flows along with corresponding confidence maps at
any intermediate time step.
• We devise a new teacher-student semi-supervised learning strategy leveraging VFI to train an optical flow
network, incorporating exponential moving averaging
(EMA) to enhance training stability.
• We demonstrate that OCAI achieves higher quality in
video interpolation than existing SOTA methods on standard datasets including Sintel and KITTI. By incorporating interpolated video information, our semi-supervised
learning scheme significantly improves the optical flow
estimation performance, e.g., 0.5+ Fl-all reduction on
KITTI test set when comparing to latest SOTA.

RealFlow [10] uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) to
train an optical flow model in a semi-supervised setting.
It first trains the model using supervision from existing
ground-truth data. Then, it synthesizes new data based on
the predicted optical flows and forward warping. After that,
it trains the network with the new data. RealFlow repeats
the these steps several times in the training process, which
is computationally expensive.
Many semi-supervised learning algorithms [25, 40] for
other tasks, such as classification and object detection, employ Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to robustly and
stably update the teacher network, using a temporal ensemble of the student network. In this paper, we leverage video interpolation and several semi-supervised training techniques to enhance model performance.
3. Proposed Approach
OCAI improves the accuracy of optical flow models by generating diverse, high-quality intermediate frames and flows,
and trains the network with new pairs in a semi-supervised
learning framework. In Section 3.1, we present our occlusion and consistency aware forward warping algorithm
for video interpolation. Next, in Section 3.2, we propose a
semi-supervised learning strategy to leverage video interpolation to better train optical flow networks.

In order to correctly perform forward warping, we need
to resolve two issues: pixel value ambiguity and missing
pixel values. Ambiguity is due to two pixels in the source
frame moving to the same location in the target frame, in
which case we need to understand which is closer to the
camera and thus, should be chosen. Missing values is because a pixel location in the target frame can correspond to
an object that is occluded in the source frame (and the occluding object moves away in target frame), where there are
no pixels representing this occluded object. This can also be
caused by an object moving closer to the camera and there
are not enough pixels in the source frame to represent the
object in the target frame.
We propose occlusion-aware weighting to resolve pixel
value ambiguity and choose the pixel that corresponds to
what is closer to the camera. We further introduce a holefilling method based on the forward-backward consistency
of optical flow. Fig. 2 provides an overview of our proposed
forward warping approach.
Occlusion-Aware Weighting to Resolve Ambiguity
We resolve pixel value ambiguity via occlusion understanding. Specifically, we assume that when a pixel is not
occluded but creates occlusion for other pixels, it corresponds to an object closer to the camera.
More specifically, we derive an occlusion-aware weighting mask to be used in warping. First, we obtain occlusion map O0,1 via forward-backward consistency [29],
which indicates occlusion region on I0; see how to compute
forward-backward consistency in Eq. 1 of [29]. Next, we
apply backward warping to O0,1 using V0?1 and by further
applying the non-occlusion mask 1 ? O0,1, we can infer the
pixels in I0 that produce occlusion, i.e., foreground pixels,
and accordingly generate the mask to select these pixels.

Experimental Setup
Video Frame Interpolation (VFI): We compare with latest SOTA VFI algorithms [12, 20, 23, 27, 47]. We use their
official codes and weights trained on Vimeo90k [45]. In addition, we compare with RIPR of RealFlow [10] as our forward warping baseline. We use their official code to generate inter-frames and RAFT [41] trained on FlyingChair
(C) [8] and FlyingThings3D (T) [28] as the optical flow
model. In OCAI, we use the same optical flow network,
i.e., RAFT trained on C+T, for fair comparison. For evaluation, we use Sintel (S) [4] and KITTI (K) [9, 30], which
are standard optical flow datasets.2 More specifically, each
test sample consists of three consecutive frames, with the
first and third used as existing frames, and the second as the
interpolation target. We use common image similarity metrics to evaluate VFI quality, including PSNR, SSIM [43],
and LPIPS (using AlexNet and VGG) [50]. More details
can be found in the supplementary file.
Semi-Supervised Optical Flow (SSOF): We use RAFT
as the network architecture, following previous semisupervised optical flow model training settings [10, 14, 18].
When evaluating on Sintel (train) and SlowFlow [15], we
first pretrain the network on C+T and then, use FlyingThings3D (T) as the labeled dataset and Sintel (S) as unlabeled
dataset. For KITTI (train) evaluation, we use FlyingThings3D as the labeled dataset and KITTI (multiview) test
as the unlabeled dataset, with initialization from C+T pretrained weight. For Sintel and KITTI (test) evaluations, we
use the same labeled datasets (i.e., C+T+S+K+HD1K [19])
following the original RAFT supervised training setting,
and use Sintel training ((It, It+2) pairs), Monkaa [28], and
KITTI (multiview) training dataset as unlabeled data. Note
that Sintel and KITTI test sets are not used as unlabeled data
for training in these test evaluations

Video Frame Interpolation
Table 1 and Fig. 5 show the performance of SOTA VFI
methods, RIPR of RealFlow, and our method on Sintel
(clean) and KITTI. We achieve the best LPIPS scores and
PSNR/SSIM scores on-par with existing SOTA solutions;
note that PSNR and SSIM do not always correctly reflect
visual quality [33]. Since SOTA methods use backward
warping and predict intermediate two optical flows (Vt?0
and Vt?1) without the inter-frame It, they do not work well
when there are large displacements, which results in blurriness (see cars in Fig 5). In contrast, forward warping methods (RIPR of RealFlow and ours) can predict accurate V0?1 and V1?0, and handles fast moving objects better. Furthermore, our OCAI method produces better VFI quality than
RealFlow, with sharper image details and fewer holes. More
interpolation results using different t values (e.g., 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8) can be found in the supplementary material.
OCAI only requires the RAFT optical flow model with
5.3M parameters and shows better VFI performance as
compared to existing SOTA methods using similar or more
network parameters. Backward-warping-based approaches
require additional training on Vimeo data with a pre-trained
optical flow model, while RIPR of RealFlow and our OCAI
only needs the pre-trained optical flow model without any
additional training. Moreover, we achieve better VFI scores
than RIPR on both Sintel and KITTI. These results demonstrate that OCAI generates accurate inter-frames without
needing depth estimation in forward warping.

Optical Flow
Table 2 shows the optical flow estimation evaluation results
on SlowFlow, Sintel, and KITTI. We see that our proposed
OCAI achieves the best performance on all datasets. Notably, it has significantly more accurate optical flow estimation as compared to latest SOTA such as RealFlow and DistractFlow. Specifically, on KITTI, OCAI brings nearly 1-
point reduction in Fl-epe when comparing to DistractFlow
and 1-point smaller Fl-all than RealFlow.
Table 3 shows the evaluation result on KITTI test dataset.
We achieve SOTA performance in semi-supervised optical
flow on KITTI, bringing a significant improvement as compared to existing SOTA semi-supervised optical flow algorithms.
5. Ablation Studies
5.1. Video Frame Interpolation
Depth weighting vs. occlusion-aware weighting. Table 4
shows the effectiveness of our occlusion- and consistencyAware forward warping for VFI. The first row shows forward image warping using depth weighting. In the second row, we replace depth weighting with our occlusionaware weighting mask, which shows comparable performance without using depth. Fig. 6 provides sample qualitative results. RIPR (from RealFlow) using depth and us ing occlusion-aware weighting both have holes (See RIPR
(D) and RIPR (M)). Since RIPR performs hole-filling using
another warped image, a hole cannot be filled when both
images have holes in the same corresponding regions (e.g.,
wings and head in Fig. 6).
Image warping vs. flow warping. In the third row of
Table 4, we show the effect of applying forward warping
to flow instead of image (see optical flows in the third row
of Fig. 7). After performing hole-filling based on optical
flow consistency, our intermediate flows are significantly
improved (see inpainted flows in the fourth row of Fig. 7).
By generating the confidence maps, we can then combine
two warped images to more accurately generate the interframe (see OCAI output in Fig. 6).

Semi-Supervised Optical Flow
Using baseline VFI for semi-supervised learning. Table 5
shows an ablation study of the semi-supervised training.
RealFlow trains the model using EM algorithm, which requires significantly more iterations. In our training, when
only using EMA, our model already has a lower Fl-all score
as compared to RealFlow with 1 EM iteration. By additionally masking the loss with confidence map and imposing image distractions, the model further improves. Note
that EMA is crucial for training stability; the training fails
to converge when teacher and student models are directly
weight-shared. Finally, when using intermediate frames and
flows generated by OCAI in training, our model achieves
significantly lower Fl-epe and Fl-all.
VFI using optical flow model trained from semisupervised scheme. After we train the optical flow in semisupervised manner, we evaluate the VFI performance of
semi-supervised training in Table 6. Our semi-supervised
training weight shows the improvements on all evaluation
metrics on all dataset except for Sintel PSNR in 6 FPS to
12 FPS setting. While our OCAI trains the optical flow in
a semi-supervised manner, improved optical flow can generate more accurate inter-frame. Our OCAI can boost the
performances of not only optical flow but also VFI.

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel scheme that significantly
augments the training of optical flow models. This effectively alleviates the lack of ground-truth optical flow labels
in existing datasets. More specifically, we first proposed an
occlusion-aware video frame interpolation method, which
can robustly generate interframes despite large motions, as
well as the intermediate optical flows. This allows us to significantly expand existing optical flow training data for free.
We further proposed a semi-supervised training approach
by leveraging the video frame interpolation. Through extensive experiments on standard optical flow benchmarks
like Sintel and KITTI, we demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed approach and that it sets the new state of the art.

Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses both 2D and 3D attentions to enable highly accurate depth completion without requiring iterative spatial propagations. Specifically, we first enhance a baseline convolutional depth completion model by applying attention to 2D features in the bottleneck and skip connections. This effectively improves the performance of this simple network and sets it on par with the latest, complex transformer-based models. Leveraging the initial depths and features from this network, we uplift the 2D features to form a 3D point cloud and construct a 3D point transformer to process it, allowing the model to explicitly learn and exploit 3D geometric features. In addition, we propose normalization techniques to process the point cloud, which improves learning and leads to better accuracy than directly using point transformers off the shelf. Furthermore, we incorporate global attention on downsampled point cloud features, which enables long-range context while still being computationally feasible. We evaluate our method, DeCoTR, on established depth completion benchmarks, including NYU Depth V2 and KITTI, showcasing that it sets new state-of-the-art performance. We further conduct zero-shot evaluations on ScanNet and DDAD benchmarks and demonstrate that DeCoTR has superior generalizability compared to existing approaches.

1Introduction
†
Depth is crucial for 3D perception in various downstream applications, such as autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality, and robotics [2, 1, 9, 11, 8, 35, 51, 50, 33, 43, 34]. However, sensor-based depth measurement is far from perfect. Such measurements often exhibit sparsity, low resolution, noise interference, and incompleteness. Various factors, including environmental conditions, motion, sensor power constraints, and the presence of specular, transparent, wet, or non-reflective surfaces, contribute to these limitations. Consequently, the task of depth completion, aimed at generating dense and accurate depth maps from sparse measurements alongside aligned camera images, has emerged as a pivotal research area

Thanks to the advances in deep learning, there has been significant progress in depth completion. Earlier papers leverage convolutional neural networks to perform depth completion with image guidance and achieve promising results [27, 3, 37]. In order to improve accuracy, researchers have studied various spatial propagation methods [25, 4, 29, 24], which performs further iterative processing on top of depth maps and features computed by an initial network. Most existing solutions build on this in the last stage of their depth completion pipeline to improve performance [17, 45]. These propagation algorithms, however, focus on 2D feature processing and do not fully exploit the 3D nature of the problem. A few recent papers utilize transformers for depth completion [45, 32]. However, they apply transformer operations mainly to improve feature learning on the 2D image plane and fail to achieve acceptable accuracy without employing spatial propagation.

Several studies have looked into harnessing 3D representation more comprehensively. For instance, [18, 49] construct a point cloud from the input sparse depth, yet coping with extreme sparsity poses challenges in effective feature learning. Another approach, as seen in [26], uplifts 2D features to 3D by using the initial dense depth predicted by a simple convolutional network, but it is impeded by the poor accuracy of the initial network and requires dynamic propagations to attain acceptable accuracy. Very recently, researchers have proposed employing transformers for 3D feature learning in depth completion [44]; however, this work applies transformer layers to extremely sparse points, which is ineffective for learning informative 3D features.

Here, we introduce DeCoTR to perform feature learning in full 3D. It accomplishes this by constructing a dense feature point cloud derived from completed depth values obtained from an initial network and subsequently applying transformer processing to these 3D points. To do this properly, it is essential to have reasonably accurate initial depths. As such, we first enhance a commonly used convolution-based initial depth network, S2D [27], by integrating transformer layers on bottleneck and skip connection features. This upgraded model, termed S2D-TR, achieves significantly improved depth accuracy, on par with state-of-the-art models, without requiring any iterative spatial propagation.

Given the initial depth map, we uplift 2D features to 3D to form a point cloud, which is subsequently processed by transformer layers, to which we refer as 3D-TR layers. Prior to feeding the points to transformer layers, we normalize them, which regularizes the 3D feature learning and leads to better accuracy. In each 3D-TR layer, we follow standard practice [46, 40] to perform neighborhood-based attention, as global attention would be computationally intractable when the number of points is large. To facilitate long-range contextual understanding, we additionally incorporate global attention on lower-scale versions of the point cloud. Finally, 3D features are projected back to the 2D image plane and consumed by a decoder to produce the final depth prediction. As we shall see in the paper, our proposed transformer-based learning in full 3D provides considerably improved accuracy and generalizability for depth completion; see Fig. 1 for a visual example.

In summary, our main contributions are as follows:

• We present DeCoTR, a novel transformer-based approach to perform full 3D feature learning for depth completion. This enables high-quality depth estimation without requiring iterative processing steps.
• In order to properly do this, we upgrade the commonly used initial network S2D, by enhancing its bottleneck and skip connection features using transformers. The resulting model, S2D-TR, performs on-par with SOTA and provides more correct depths to subsequent 3D learning.
• We devise useful techniques to normalize the uplifted 3D feature point cloud, which improves the model learning. We additionally apply low-resolution global attention to 3D points, which enhances long-range understanding without making computation infeasible.
• Through extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks, NYU Depth v2 [36] and KITTI [14], we demonstrate the efficacy of DeCoTR and show that it sets the new SOTA, e.g., new best result on NYU Depth v2. Our zero-shot testing on ScanNet [7] and DDAD [15] further showcases the better generalizability of our model as compared to existing methods.

Depth completion: Early depth completion approaches [38, 16, 22] rely solely on the sparse depth measurements to estimate the dense depth. Since these methods do not utilize the image, they usually suffer from artifacts like blurriness, especially at object boundaries. Later, image-guided depth completion alleviates these issues by incorporating the image. S2D [27], one of the first papers on this, leverages a convolutional network to consume both the image and sparse depth map. Subsequent papers design more sophisticated convolutional models for depth completion [31, 3, 19, 48, 37]. In order to enhance depth quality, researchers have studied various spatial propagation algorithms [4, 5, 29, 24]. These solutions utilize depth values and features given by an initial network (usually S2D), and performs iterative steps to mix and aggregate features on the 2D image plane. In many papers nowadays, it has become a common practice to use spatial propagation on top of the proposed depth completion network in order to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy [17, 28, 45]. Some recent works more tightly integrate iterative processing into the network, using architectures like recurrent network [39] and repetitive hourglass network [42].

While existing solutions predominately propose architectures to process features on 2D, several works explore 3D representations. For instance, [18, 49, 44] considers the sparse depth as a point cloud and learn features from it. However, the extremely sparse points present a challenge to feature learning. One of these works, GraphCSPN [26], employs S2D as an initial network to generate the full depth map, before creating a denser point cloud and performing feature learning on it. However, this is limited by the insufficient accuracy of the initial depths by S2D and still needs iterative processing to achieve good accuracy.

Vision transformer: Even since its introduction [10], vision transformers have been extensively studied and utilized for various computer vision tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, tracking, 3D reconstruction, and more. We refer readers to these surveys for a more comprehensive coverage of these works. More related to our paper are those that leverage vision transformers for depth completion, such as CompletionFormer [45] and GuideFormer [32]. While they demonstrate the effectiveness of using vision transformers for depth completion, their feature learning is only performed on the 2D image plane. A very recent paper, PointDC [44], proposes to apply transformer to 3D point cloud in the depth completion pipeline. However, PointDC operates on very sparse points, which makes it challenging for learning 3D features.

3Method
In this section, we present our proposed approach, DeCoTR, powered by efficient 2D and powerful 3D attention learning. The overall pipeline of DeCoTR is shown in Fig. 2.

Experiments
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed DeCoTR on standard depth completion benchmarks and compare with the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. We further perform zero-shot evaluation to assess the model generalizability and carry out ablation studies to analyze different parts of our proposed approach.

4.1Experimental Setup
Datasets: We perform standard depth completion evaluations on NYU Depth v2 (NYUD-v2) [36] and KITTI Depth Completion (KITTI-DC) [13, 14], and generalization tests on ScanNet-v2 [7] and DDAD [15]. These datasets cover a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. We follow the sampling settings from existing works to create input sparse depth [29, 26].

NYUD-v2 provides RGB images and depth maps captured by a Kinect device from 464 different indoor scenes. We use the official split: 249 scenes for training and the remaining 215 for testing. Following the common practice [29, 26, 45], we sample 
?
50,000 images from the training set and resize the image size from 
480
×
640
 first to half and then to 
228
×
304
 with center cropping. We use the official test set of 654 images for evaluation.

KITTI is a large real-world dataset in the autonomous driving domain, with over 90,000 paired RGB images and LiDAR depth measurements. There are two versions of KITTI dataset used for depth completion. One is from [27], which consists of 46,000 images from the training sequences for training and a random subset of 3,200 images from the test sequences for evaluation. The other one is KITTI Depth Completion (KITTI-DC) dataset, which provides 86,000 training, 6,900 validation, and 1,000 testing samples with corresponding raw LiDAR scans and reference images. We use KITTI-DC to train and test our model on the official splits.

ScanNet-v2 contains 1,513 room scans reconstructed from RGB-D frames. The dataset is divided into 1,201 scenes for training and 312 for validation, and provides an additional 100 scenes for testing. For sparse input depths, we sample point clouds from vertices of the reconstructed meshes. We use the 100 test scenes to evaluate depth completion performance, with 20 frames randomly selected per scene. We remove samples where more than 10% of the ground-truth depth values are missing, resulting in 745 test frames across all 100 test scenes.

DDAD is an autonomous driving dataset collected in the U.S. and Japan using a synchronized 6-camera array, featuring long-range (up to 250m) and diverse urban driving scenarios. Following [15], we downsample the images from the original resolution of 
1216
×
1936
 to 
384
×
640
. We use the official 3,950 validation samples for evaluation. Since after downsampling there’s only less than 
5
%
 valid ground truth depth, for our method and all the comparing we sample all the available valid depth points so that reasonable results are generated.

Implementation Details: We implement our proposed approach using PyTorch [30]. We use the Adam [21] optimizer with an initial learning rate of

, and no weight decay. The batch size for NYUDv2 and KITTI-DC per GPU is set to 8 and 4, respectively. All experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Evaluation: We use standard metrics to evaluate depth completion performance [12], including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Absolute Relative Error (Abs Rel),

. On KITTI-DC test, we use the official metrics: RMSE, MAE, iRMSE and iMAE. We refer readers to the supplementary file for detailed mathematical definitions of these metrics. The depth values are evaluated with maximum distances of 80 meters and 200 meters for KITTI and DDAD, respectively, and 10 meters for NYUD-v2 and ScanNet.

4.2Results on NYUD-v2 and KITTI
Refer to caption
Figure 3:Qualitative results on NYUD-v2. We compare with SOTA methods such as NLSPN, GraphCSPN, and CompletionFormer. Areas where DeCoTR provides better depth accuracy are highlighted.
On NYUD-v2: Table 1 summarizes the quantitative evaluation results on NYUD-v2. Our proposed DeCoTR approach sets the new SOTA performance, with the lowest RMSE of 0.086 outperforming all existing solutions. When not using 3D global attention, DeCoTR already provides the best accuracy and global attention further improves it. Specifically, our DeCoTR considerably outperforms latest SOTA methods that also leverage 3D representation and/or transformers, such as GraphCSPN, PointDC, and CompletionFormer. Note that although PointDC uses both 3D representation and transformer, it only obtains slightly lower RMSE when comparing to methods that do not use 3D or transformer (e.g., CompletionFormer, GraphCSPN). This indicates that the PointDC approach is suboptimal, potentially due to the extremely sparse 3D points.

Fig. 3 provides sample qualitative results on NYUD-v2. We see that DeCoTR generates highly accurate dense depth maps that are very close to the ground truth. The depth maps produced by DeCoTR capture much finer details as compared to existing SOTA methods. For instance, in the second example, our proposed approach accurately predicts the depth on the faucet despite its small size in the images and the low contrast, while other methods struggle.

On KITTI-DC: We evaluate DeCoTR and compare with existing methods (including latest SOTA) on the official KITTI test set, as shown in Table 2. DeCoTR achieves SOTA depth completion accuracy and is among the top-ranking methods on KITTI-DC leaderboard.1 We see that DeCoTR performs significantly better than existing SOTA methods that leverage 3D representations, e.g., GraphCSPN, PointDC. This indicates that DeCoTR has the right combination of dense 3D representation and transformer-based learning.

Zero-Shot Testing on ScanNet and DDAD
Most existing papers only evaluate their models on NYUD-v2 and KITTI, without looking into model generalizability. In this part, we perform cross-dataset evaluation. More specifically, we run zero-shot testing of NYUD-v2-trained models on ScanNet-v2 and KITTI-trained models on DDAD. This will allow us to understand how well our DeCoTR as well as existing SOTA models generalize to data not seen in training.

Tables 3 and 4 present evaluation results on ScanNet-v2 and DDAD, respectively. We see that DeCoTR generalizes better to unseen datasets when comparing to existing SOTA models. It it noteworthy to mention that on DDAD, DeCoTR has significantly lower depth errors as compared to both NLSPN and CompletionFormer, despite that CompletionFormer has slightly lower RMSE on KITTI-DC test. Moreover, in this case, CompletionFormer has even worse accuracy than NLSPN, indicating its poor generalizability.

Fig. 5 shows sample visual results of zero-shot depth completion on ScanNet-v2. DeCoTR generates highly accurate depth maps and captures fine details, e.g., arm rest in the first example, lamp in the second example. Other methods cannot recover the depths accurately. Fig. 6 provides qualitative results on DDAD for CompletionFormer and our DeCoTR. While this is a challenging test setting given the much larger depth range in DDAD, DeCoTR still predicts reasonable depths. In contrast, it can be seen that CompletionFormer performs very poorly on DDAD. We notice that DeCoTR’s predictions are more accurate in the nearer range (e.g., on cars) and less so when it is far away (e.g., on trees), since KITTI training only covers up to 80 meters whereas DDAD has depth up to 200 meters. This is also confirmed by the lower-than-KITTI RMSE and higher-than-KITTI MAE numbers of DeCoTR on DDAD.

4.4Ablation Study
In this part, we investigate the effectiveness of various design aspects of our proposed DeCoTR solution. Table 5 summarizes the ablation study results. Starting from the S2D baseline, we significantly improve depth completion performance by introducing efficient attention on the 2D features, reducing RMSE from 0.204 to 0.094. Next, by using neighborhood-based cross-attention on the 3D points (without normalizing the point cloud before 3D-TR layers), we reduce RMSE to 0.089. Even though scaling a 3D scene to a uniform perceived range may present a challenge to maintain the original spatial relationship, after applying our normalization scheme, DeCoTR achieves a better RMSE of 0.087 and by additionally incorporating efficient global attention, the RMSE is further improved to 0.086. This study verifies the usefulness of our proposed components and techniques.

Refer to caption
Figure 6:Qualitative results of zero-shot inference on DDAD. Areas where DeCoTR provide better depth accuracy are highlighted.
Note that if we directly apply 3D-TR on top of the original S2D network (second row in the table), we can still drastically improve upon S2D but fail to outperform existing methods that leverage 3D or transformers such as GraphCSPN and CompletionFormer. This confirms the importance of getting more accurate initial depth before applying 3D feature learning.

5Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, DeCoTR, for image-guided depth completion, by employing transformer-based learning in full 3D. We first proposed an efficient attention scheme to upgrade the common baseline of S2D, allowing S2D-TR to provide more accurate initial depth completion. 2D features are then uplifted to form a 3D point cloud followed by 3D-TR layers that apply powerful neighborhood-based cross-attention on the 3D points. We further devised an efficient global attention operation to provide scene-level understanding while keeping computation costs in check. Through extensive experiments, we have shown that DeCoTR achieves SOTA performance on standard benchmarks like NYUD-v2 and KITTI-DC. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on unseen datasets such as ScanNet and DDAD shows that DeCoTR has better generalizability as compared to existing methods.

Abstract
The rise of new video modalities like virtual reality or
autonomous driving has increased the demand for efficient multi-view video compression methods, both in terms
of rate-distortion (R-D) performance and in terms of delay and runtime. While most recent stereo video compression approaches have shown promising performance,
they compress left and right views sequentially, leading
to poor parallelization and runtime performance. This
work presents Low-Latency neural codec for Stereo video
Streaming (LLSS), a novel parallel stereo video coding
method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo
video streaming. Instead of using a sequential cross-view
motion compensation like existing methods, LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to directly exploit mutual information among views and encode them effectively with a joint cross-view prior model for entropy
coding. Thanks to this design, LLSS processes left and right
views in parallel, minimizing latency; all while substantially improving R-D performance compared to both existing neural and conventional codecs.
1. Introduction
The rise in popularity of autonomous vehicles (AVs)
equipped with stereo cameras, along with the widespread
use of virtual reality (VR) headsets, has led to a significant increase in stereo video data. For AVs, stereo cameras
serve as a cost-effective alternative to sensors like LIDAR or
RADAR. The data they capture is crucial for time-sensitive
safety analyses during vehicle operation, necessitating lowlatency data transmission. In VR, to achieve an immersive
user experience, the demands for both resolution and latency are even higher. For both AV and VR applications,
it’s crucial that the codec encodes stereo video efficiently
while maintaining low latency

In this work, we present a Low-Latency Stereo video
1
arXiv:2403.17879v1 [cs.CV] 26 Mar 2024
Streaming (LLSS) codec designed for parallel stereo video
coding. This codec’s development is grounded in two
key insights. First, inspired from the recent progresses
in the stereo matching methods [9, 20, 50], the disparity
compensation module between left and right views can be
greatly simplified, compared to complex motion compensation schemes in LSVC [10]. It can be efficiently represented
with horizontal shifts. Second, we observed that these
disparity compensations can be executed concurrently for
both views. A careful encoder design, sharing horizontallyshifted features across views, can implicitly estimate disparity, while facilitating parallel processing of both views,
thereby achieving low-latency inference. Figure 1 shows a
schematic comparison of these approaches. We introduce a
novel component, BiShiftMod (Bidirectional Shifting Module), which facilitates the connections and information exchange between views in our network. This module is integrated into both the codec and hypercodec [5, 42], which
enables data-dependent optimization of the cross-view mutual information. By following this approach, we replace
the sequential disparity compensation with a parallel coding network that can exploit cross-view mutual information
in a “disparity-agnostic” fashion.

Finally, we show that our solution substantially improves
R-D performance compared to the state-of-the-art method
on three common stereo video benchmarks, with 50.6%
BD-rate savings on the CityScapes dataset [11], 18.2% on
the KITTI 2012 dataset [17] and 15.8% on the KITTI 2015
dataset [41]. Besides, we also provide a neural network
complexity and inference time study, and show that our
model has only 35% of the complexity of LSVC [10] in
terms of FLOPS. We further ablate each design choice to
showcase the contribution of the proposed modules toward
the final R-D performance.
The contributions of this paper include:
• A novel low-latency neural stereo video codec architecture that replaces sequential inter-view compensation
with an efficient and parallelizable learned module to connect parallel autoencoders
• A bidirectional shift module that effectively captures and
exhibits redundancy between inter-view features
• A set of thorough experiments demonstrating that our
method is fast, efficient, and obtaining comparable and
often better than state-of-the-art methods

The main advantage of neural codecs is that they learn to
compress from example data, whereas handcrafted codecs
require expert design. This allows for easy customization to new domains [21], or even to specific videos or
datapoints [52, 57, 58, 67]. Additionally, they may provide advantages from a deployment perspective. In practice, standard codecs often use hardware-based implementations to enable efficient operation, especially on mobile
devices. However, these implementations tend to require
a longer deployment process. In contrast, software-based
neural codecs only need generic and ubiquitous AI accelerators for operation, making them more flexible and with the
potential to enhance various application domains, especially
where hardware-based codecs are not available. Lastly, neural codecs can be optimized end-to-end to improve perceptual quality through the use of perceptual loss functions
[1, 18, 40, 43, 66], or take the semantics of the video into
account via region-of-interest coding [8, 15]. Despite these
dissimilarities, neural video codecs have taken inspiration
from handcrafted codecs. Early works used temporal architectures [19, 21, 64], but follow-up work quickly adopted
subnetworks for motion compensation and residual coding
in the low latency [2, 38, 46, 48, 49] and streaming setting [30, 46]. Recently, neural video codecs have adopted
advanced motion compensation techniques [25] and conditional coding, allowing them to become competitive with
standard codecs in the low latency setting [35, 36].
2.2. Standard stereo video codecs
Although single-view codecs achieve strong compression
performance, applying them to the stereo (and more broadly
multi-view) domain by independently coding each view
would lead to a suboptimal linear increase in rate. For this
reason, early works in image coding extended support to
stereo images by using disparity compensation [39, 45].
The idea is to encode one view independently, then predict the other view, for instance, with motion compensation.
Then, the difference between this prediction and the ground
truth is quantized and transmitted.

 Parallel AutoEncoders
As illustrated in Figure 2, LLSS has two pairs of parallel
autoencoders: parallel motion autoencoder and parallel
context autoencoder. Inside each of them, there are two
autoencoders running in parallel corresponding to the left
and right views. The architecture of each single autoencoder is adopted from recent state-of-the-art feature-based
video codec [25]. Due to the limited space, we would like
to refer the reader to the original paper [25] for more details of its architecture. Briefly, each autoencoder contains
a residual-based encoder to transform its input into highly
compressible latent, which is then coded with the help of a
hyper prior network before being decoded back to the expected output via another residual-based decoder.
To enhance the intra-view information flow, the residual autoencoder compressing the residual feature Rt =
Ft ?F¯
t, originally in FVC [25] is replaced by a conditional
autoencoder inspired by [35]. In this conditional autoencoder, Ft is fed directly into the encoder, and both encoder
and decoder are conditioned on the warped feature F¯
t. Additionally, F¯
t is fed into hyper codec to enhance the estimation of the parameters of the prior model.
To boost the inter-view information flow, we propose the
“Bidirectional Shift Module”. In summary, this block connects the modules of encoders and decoders of the left and
right branches together to enable the flow of information
across views, as illustrated in Figure 4. The next section
details the implementation of this block.
3.2.2 Bidirectional Shift Module
Figure 4 shows the architecture of a Bidirectional Shift
Module. It takes as input a pair of inter-view features,
one from each branch of the codec, and outputs a pair
of enhanced features. Inside, the inter-view features will
be first transformed into a more representative form of intermediate features via a set of group-based convolutions.
These intermediate features are then shifted via a module BiShift(D,S). The shifted features are then passed
through a set of Groupwise and Concatenation-based blocks
to estimate their correlation.

4. Experiments
Datasets. We make use of 4 different datasets. For training, we use the single-view Vimeo90K dataset [65] for pretraining and then the stereo-camera CityScape dataset [11]
train set for finetuning. For evaluation we use Cityscapes
test set and the stereo-video KITTI 2012 [17] and 2015 [41]
datasets.
The CityScapes [11] testing dataset comprises 1,525
30-frame stereo sequence pairs, with each containing two
streams of size 2048 × 1024. The KITTI 2012 and 2015
testing datasets include 195 and 200 stereo sequence pairs,
respectively, each containing 21 frames. We follow LSVC
[10] data pre-processing for the CityScape and KITTI
datasets, all frames are cropped into size 1920 × 704 and
1216 × 320, respectively.
Evaluation metrics. We measure rate in bits-per-pixel
(BPP), and assess reconstruction fidelity with the commonly used Peak Signal-to-Noise Rate (PSNR) and MultiScale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM) [60] metrics. To
summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we
also report the Bjøntegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) [6], which
can be interpreted as an average bitrate saving for a fixed
quality compared to a reference codec. All scores are reported in the RGB color space. We evaluate our methods
with a Group-of-Picture (GoP) size equal to the total sequence length i.e., 30 and 21 frames for the CityScape and
KITTI datasets, respectively. For model efficiency, we report the number of parameters along with FLOP and MAC
per pixel. We measure the inference GPU time using the
function torch.cuda.Event() as well as the function
torch.cuda.synchronize() from the official PyTorch
library [44], while FLOPs and MACs are calculated using
get model profile from the DeepSpeed library [4, 13].
Training details. We implemented our neural stereo video
codec using PyTorch [44]. Following a similar strategy
to [10], we train our models in 3 stages:
First, a single view version of our model (hence without the “BiShiftMod” modules) is randomly initialized. We
train the single view model on the Vimeo90k dataset and
make use of its size and diversity. We train for 2M iterations with a learning rate of 5 · 10?5
, using MSE as distortion loss. Second, the resulting pre-trained weights from
the first stage are used to initialize both branches of the
full stereo network. We then train the BiShiftMod modules while freezing all other modules. During this step, we
train the network for 10k iterations on the CityScape dataset
with a learning rate of 1·10?5
. We found this step to greatly
stabilize the training process. Finally, we finetune the entire
network on the CityScape dataset for 200k iterations with
a learning rate of 1 · 10?5
. When reporting MS-SSIM performance, we use a version of our network which is further finetuned using MS-SSIM as distortion loss for an additional 100k iterations

Standard Baselines. We compare our work to two standard
baselines: H.265 [53] and its multi-view extension MVHEVC [54]. We obtain the results of the standard codecs
from the LSVC [10] paper. For H.265, it uses the HM16.20 [23] implementation in the “lowdelay P main” preset
on each view independently. MV-HEVC is from the HTM16.3 implementation [24] with “baseCfg 2view” preset.
Learned Baselines. The only learned stereo video codec to
date is LSVC by Chen et al. [10]. Like them, we include a
comparison to a single-view codec FVC by Hu et al. [25],
in which feature-based warping and residual compensation
were introduced and inspired LSVC architecture. We report the scores of H.265, MV-HEVC, FVC, and LSVC as
recorded in Chen et al. [10]. Besides, we also compare with
DCVC [34]. Since DCVC didn’t release the training codes,
we evaluated it without finetuning. Therefore, the comparison between our method with DCVC should be interpreted
with a grain of salt.
4.1. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
Figure 5 and Table 1 respectively show the rate-distortion
curves and BD-rate (with MV-HEVC as anchor) of all methods considered on the CityScapes, KITTI 2012 and 2015
test sets. Our LLSS method outperforms both learned
and standard state-of-the-art methods. On the CityScape
dataset, our method achieves 50.6% BD-rate savings compared to MV-HEVC, while LSVC only saved 32.7%. On the
KITTI 2012 and 2015 datasets, our method attains 18.2%
and 15.8% BD-rate savings, respectively.
Note that for KITTI datasets, the gap in R-D performance to LSVC has tightened. We tested our method on the
KITTI datasets without finetuning, following LSVC. However, KITTI and CityScapes datasets have different data distributions due to camera settings and baselines, and image
processing settings. These differences lead to significant
variations in BPP and PSNR ranges when applying conventional and data-driven methods codecs. Especially all
neural codecs relying on training data so tend to be less performant in this setting. Despite these challenges, our LLSS
method still achieves comparable and often better results
than all existing conventional and neural codecs. Compared
to LSVC, our method obtains an improvement of 1.1% and
2.4% BD-rate gain on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, respectively, while being much faster. This demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method and
its potential to further improve its performance in the future
with more generalized datasets.

. Computational complexity study
In this study, we evaluate the complexity of both the transmitter and receiver components. The transmitter encompasses the entire network, as both encoding and decoding
operations are carried out in order to create the bit streams.
The receiver however only encompasses the feature extractor for previous frames, the parallel motion decoding module, the motion compensation, the parallel context decoding module, and the image reconstructor. As stated in Section 4, note that LSVC does not report complexity numbers,
hence we re-implemented their architecture in order to get
the complexity numbers.
We reduced the complexity of our method by observing that the pixel displacement in cross-view disparity of a
pair of stereo frames is simpler and more predictable than
the one caused by temporal motion. When compressing
temporal motion and disparity cross views, LSVC requires
large and complex networks (MRC and DRC). Our method
greatly simplifies this by designing an efficient BiShiftMod to align features cross-view. In the supplementary,
we showed that our BiShiftMod accounts for only a small
fraction of the overall computational complexity. Due to
BiShiftMod, our parallel autoencoders have been designed
to be more streamlined and efficient.
We examine the complexity of the transmitter and receiver in terms of inference time, FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs), and Multiply-Add Cumulation (MACs). To
investigate how these metrics perform for various video
sizes, we crop the videos to the sizes including 128 × 128, 256×128, 256×256, 512×256, 512×512, and 768×512.
Our experiments are conducted on a single Nvidia 3080
GPU, with a batch size of 1. We report the complexity
for one pair of stereo P-frames and compare our method
to the state-of-the-art stereo video compression approach,
LSVC [10]. As illustrated in Figure 6, our method successfully reduces computational complexity across all examined metrics. For instance, considering a pair of stereo
frames of size 512 × 512, our transmitter achieves an inference time 1.7× times faster than LSVC, while our receiver
is 1.9× times quicker. In terms of FLOPs, LSVC exhibits
2.8× and 3.2× times higher complexity for the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Similarly, for MACs, LSVC
demonstrates 2.8× and 3.3× times higher complexity for
the transmitter and receiver, respectively

Effectiveness of the BiShiftMod. We evaluate the effectiveness of the BiShiftMod by conducting tests it on the
codec and hypercodec. When training the network without BiShiftMod, we skip the second training step. Figure 7
demonstrates that BiShiftMod significantly enhances the
rate-distortion (RD) performance on the CityScape dataset.
Specifically, employing BishiftMod on the codec and hypercodec lead to BD-rate savings of 7.3% and 6.1% compared
to the configuration without BishftMod, respectively. When
applied to the entire network, BishiftMod achieves 13.0%
BD-rate reduction. These improvements can be attributed
to BiShiftMod’s robust ability to reduce rates, highlighting
the efficacy of our BiShiftMod architecture.
Effectiveness of the BishiftMod components. We remove
the component from BishftMod, including the groupwise
correlation (CroupCor) and concatenation-based correlation
(CatCor). Figure 7 shows the RD curve on the cityscape
dataset. Both GroupCor and CatCor improve the results.
Removing GroupCor and CatCor results in 3.7% and 4.3%
BD-rate increasing, respectively, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our network architecture.
Effectiveness of parallel feature. We concatenate the left
and right features as a single feature. Figure 7 shows that
our paralleled feature streams approach achieves 62% BDrate saving compared to using single shared feature. Our approach to split features into views and explicitly model their
cross-view redundancy is more effective than simply asking a network to perform all of these operations implicitly,
which is consistent with the many other works on monocular video compression tasks that compressing frames without modeling the motion tends to spend more bits.

Visualization of latent features. Figure 8 displays the latent features from the left and right branches with the top8 largest average energy. We compare the differences between the left and right branches. The first two rows are
from the model without BiShiftMod, while the bottom two
rows are from the model with BiShiftMod. In the absence of
BiShiftMod, the latent features appear very similar. However, when BiShiftMod is present, the latent features become less alike, indicating that BiShiftMod successfully reduces redundancy between the left and right branches.
5. Conclusion
We present a low-latency neural stereo video compression
method designed to simultaneously compress left and right
views. We develop a bidirectional-shift compression network for this purpose. The bidirectional-shift module effectively and efficiently captures the redundancy between
the left and right frames. Our experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, the experiments show that our
bidirectional-shift module and parallel autoencoders contribute to the reduced bit rates and improved frame quality.

Semi-supervised learning for NLP Our work broadly falls into the category of semi-supervised
learning for natural language. This paradigm has attracted a lot of interest and has applications in
tasks such as sequence tagging [24, 33, 57] or text classification [41, 70]. The earliest approaches used
unlabeled data to compute word- or phrase-level statistics, which were then used as features in a
supervised model [33]. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated the benefits of using
word embeddings [11, 39, 42] trained on unlabeled corpora to improve performance on a
variety of tasks [8, 11, 26, 45]. However, these approaches mainly transfer word-level information,
while we aim to capture higher-level semantics.
More recent approaches have explored learning and exploiting more than just word-level semantics from
unlabeled data. Phrase- or sentence-level embeddings, which can be trained on an unlabeled corpus, have been used to encode text into appropriate vector representations for various target tasks [28, 32, 1, 36, 22, 12, 56, 31]. Unsupervised Pretraining Unsupervised pretraining is a special case of semi-supervised learning where the goal is to find a good initialization point rather than changing the goal of supervised learning. Early work investigated the use of the technique in image classification [20, 49, 63] and regression tasks [3]. Subsequent research [15] showed that pretraining acts as a regularization scheme and enables better generalization in deep neural networks. In recent work, the method has been used to train deep neural networks for various tasks such as image classification [69], speech recognition [68], entity disambiguation [17], and machine translation [48]. The closest approach to our work is to pre-train a neural network with a language modeling objective and then optimize it under supervision on a target task. Dai et al. [13] and Howard and Ruder [21] follow this method to improve text classification. Although the pre-training phase helps to capture some linguistic information, their use of LSTM models limits their predictive ability to a short range. In contrast, our choice of transformer networks allows us to capture longer-range linguistic structures, as shown by our experiments. In addition, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a wider range of tasks, including natural language recognition, paraphrase detection, and story completion. Other approaches [43, 44, 38] use hidden representations from a pre-trained language or machine translation model as auxiliary features while training a supervised model on the target task. This requires a significant amount of new parameters for each individual target task, while we require minimal changes to our model architecture during transfer.

This paradigm has attracted significant interest, with applications to
tasks like sequence labeling [24, 33, 57] or text classification [41, 70]. In recent work, the method has
been used to help train deep neural networks on various tasks like image classification [69], speech
recognition [68], entity disambiguation [17] and machine translation [48]. Subsequent research [15] demonstrated that pre-training acts as a regularization
scheme, enabling better generalization in deep neural networks. Over the last few years, researchers have demonstrated the benefits of using
word embeddings [11, 39, 42], which are trained on unlabeled corpora, to improve performance on a
variety of tasks [8, 11, 26, 45]. [13] and Howard and
Ruder [21] follow this method to improve text classification. This involves a substantial amount of new parameters for each separate
target task, whereas we require minimal changes to our model architecture during transfer. Recent approaches have investigated learning and utilizing more than word-level semantics from

Task-specific input transformations
For some tasks, such as text classification, we can fine-tune our model directly as described above.
Certain other tasks, such as question answering or text implications, have structured inputs such as
ordered sentence pairs or document-question-answer triplets. Since our pre-trained model was trained on contiguous text sequences, we need to make some changes to be able to apply it to these tasks.
Previous work proposed learning task-specific architectures based on transferred representations [44].
Such an approach reintroduces a significant amount of task-specific customization and does not use
transfer learning for these additional architecture components. Instead, we use a traversal-like
approach [52], where we transform structured inputs into an ordered sequence that our pre-trained model can process. These input transformations allow us to avoid extensive changes to the
architecture across tasks. We give a brief description of these input transformations below, and
Figure 1 provides a visual illustration. All transformations involve adding randomly initialized start and end tokens (hsi, hei).
Textual implication For implication tasks, we concatenate the token sequences of the premise p and hypothesis h with a separator token ($) in between.
Similarity For similarity tasks, there is no inherent order of the two sentences being compared.
To reflect this, we modify the input sequence to contain both possible sentence orders (with a separator in between) and process each independently to produce two sequence representations h
m
l
that are added element-wise before being fed into the linear output layer.
Question answering and common sense For these tasks, we are given a context document z, a question q, and a set of possible answers {ak}. We concatenate the document context
and the question with each possible answer and insert a separator token in between to form [z; q; $; ak]. Each of these sequences is processed independently with our model and then normalized via a softmax layer to produce an output distribution over possible responses.

Task-specific input transformations
For some tasks, like text classification, we can directly fine-tune our model as described above. Textual entailment For entailment tasks, we concatenate the premise p and hypothesis h token
sequences, with a delimiter token ($) in between. Previous work proposed learning task specific architectures on top of transferred representations [44]. Similarity For similarity tasks, there is no inherent ordering of the two sentences being compared. Certain other tasks, like question answering or textual entailment, have structured inputs such as
ordered sentence pairs, or triplets of document, question, and answers. These input transformations allow us to avoid making extensive changes to the
architecture across tasks. Question Answering and Commonsense Reasoning For these tasks, we are given a context
document z, a question q, and a set of possible answers {ak}. Each
of these sequences are processed independently with our model and then normalized via a softmax
layer to produce an output distribution over possible answers. To reflect this, we modify the input sequence to contain both possible sentence orderings (with a
delimiter in between) and process each independently to produce two sequence representations h
m
l
which are added element-wise before being fed into the linear output layer. We concatenate the document context
and question with each possible answer, adding a delimiter token in between to get [z; q; $; ak]. Such an approach re-introduces a significant amount of task-specific customization and does not
use transfer learning for these additional architectural components. Since our pre-trained model
was trained on contiguous sequences of text, we require some modifications to apply it to these tasks. We provide a brief description of these input transformations below and
Figure 1 provides a visual illustration. All transformations include adding randomly initialized start
and end tokens (hsi, hei). Instead, we use a traversal-style
approach [52], where we convert structured inputs into an ordered sequence that our pre-trained
model can process.

Model specifications Our model largely follows the original Transformer work [62]. We trained a
12-layer decoder-only transformer with masked self-attention heads (768-dimensional states and 12
attention heads). For the position-wise feedforward networks, we used 3072-dimensional inner states.
We used the Adam optimization scheme [27] with a maximum learning rate of 2.5e-4. The learning rate
was linearly increased from zero over the first 2000 updates and annealed to 0 using a cosine schedule.
We train for 100 epochs with minibatches of 64 randomly selected, contiguous sequences of 512 tokens.
Since Layernorm [2] is used extensively throughout the model, a simple weight initialization of
N(0, 0.02) was sufficient. We used a bytepair encoding vocabulary (BPE) with 40,000 merges [53]
and residual, embedding and attention dropouts at a rate of 0.1 for regularization. We
also used a modified version of the L2 regularization proposed in [37] with w = 0.01 for all non-bias or gain weights. For the activation function, we used the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) [18]. We
used learned positional embeddings instead of the sinusoidal version proposed in the original work.
We use the ftfy library2
to clean the raw text in BooksCorpus, standardize some punctuation and
space, and use the spaCy tokenizer.3
Fine-tuning details Unless otherwise stated, we reuse the hyperparameter settings from the unsupervised
pretraining. We add dropouts to the classifier at a rate of 0.1. For most tasks, we use a learning rate of 6.25e-5 and a batch size of 32. Our model is fast to fine-tune and 3 training epochs were sufficient for most cases. We use a linear learning rate decay schedule with warm-up over 0.2% of training. ? was set to 0.5. 4.2 Supervised Fine-Tuning We conduct experiments on a variety of supervised tasks, including natural language recognition, question answering, semantic similarity, and text classification. Some of these tasks are available as part of the recently published GLUE multitasking benchmark [64], which we use. Figure 1 provides an overview of all tasks and datasets.

Natural Language Inference The task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as textual implication detection, consists in reading a pair of sentences and judging the relationship between them based on implication, contradiction, or neutrality. Although there has been much interest recently [58, 35, 44], the task remains challenging due to the presence of a variety of phenomena such as lexical implication, coreference, and lexical and syntactic ambiguity. We evaluate five datasets with different sources, including image captions (SNLI), transcribed speech, popular literature and government reports (MNLI), Wikipedia articles (QNLI), scientific exams (SciTail), or news articles (RTE). Table 2 shows different results of the different NLI tasks for our model and previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our method significantly outperforms the baselines on four of the five datasets, achieving absolute improvements of up to 1.5% on MNLI, 5% on SciTail, 5.8% on QNLI, and 0.6% on SNLI over the previous best results. This demonstrates the ability of our model to better reason across multiple sentences and handle aspects of linguistic ambiguity. On RTE, one of the smaller datasets we evaluate (2490 examples), we achieve an accuracy of 56%, which is lower than the 61.7% reported by a multitasking biLSTM model. Given the strong performance of our approach on larger NLI datasets, it is likely that our model will also benefit from multitasking training, but we have not investigated this at present.Question Answering and Reasoning Reasoning Another task that requires aspects of single- and multi-part reasoning is question answering. We use the recently released RACE dataset [30], which consists of English text passages with associated questions from middle and high school exams. This corpus has been shown to contain more logical reasoning questions than other datasets such as CNN [19] or SQuaD [47], thus providing the perfect evaluation for our model trained to deal with long-term contexts. In addition, we evaluate the Story Cloze test [40], which involves selecting the correct ending for multi-part stories from two options. On these tasks, our model again outperforms previous best results by a large margin – up to 8.9% on Story Cloze and 5.7% overall on RACE. This demonstrates the ability of our model to effectively deal with long-term contexts.

Although there has been a lot of recent interest [ 58 , 35 , 44 ] , the task remains challenging due to the presence of a wide variety of phenomena like lexical entailment , coreference , and lexical and syntactic ambiguity . We evaluate on five datasets with diverse sources , including image captions ( SNLI ) , transcribed speech , popular fiction , and government reports ( MNLI ) , Wikipedia articles ( QNLI ) , science exams ( SciTail ) or news articles ( RTE ) . Table 2 details various results on the different NLI tasks for our model and previous state-of-the-art approaches . Our method significantly outperforms the baselines on four of the five datasets , achieving absolute improvements of upto 1.5 % on MNLI , 5 % on SciTail , 5.8 % on QNLI and 0.6 % on SNLI over the previous best results . This demonstrates our model ’ s ability to better reason over multiple sentences , and handle aspects of linguistic ambiguity . On RTE , one of the smaller datasets we evaluate on ( 2490 examples ) , inference we achieve an accuracy of 56 % , which is below the 61.7 % reported by a multi-task biLSTM model . Given the strong performance of our approach on larger NLI datasets , deduction it is likely our model will benefit from multi-task training as well but we have not explored this currently.Question answering and commonsense reasoning Another task that requires aspects of single and multi-sentence reasoning is question answering . We use the recently released RACE dataset [ 30 ] , consisting of English passages with associated questions from middle and high school exams . This termination corpus has been shown to contain more reasoning type questions that other datasets like CNN [ 19 ] or SQuaD [ 47 ] , providing the perfect evaluation for our model which is trained to handle long-range contexts . In addition , we evaluate on the Story Cloze Test [ 40 ] accomplish , which involves selecting the correct ending to multi-sentence stories from two options . On these tasks , our model again outperforms the previous best results by significant margins - up to 8.9 % on Story Cloze , and 5.7 % overall on RACE . This demonstrates the ability of our model to handle long-range contexts effectively .

Semantic Similarity Semantic similarity (or paraphrase detection) tasks involve predicting whether
two sentences are semantically equivalent or not. The challenges are to detect reformulation of
concepts, understand negations, and deal with syntactic ambiguity. We use three datasets for this
task – the Microsoft Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) [14] (collected from news sources), the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset [9], and the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) [6].
We achieve state-of-the-art results on two of the three semantic similarity tasks (Table 4), with an absolute gain of 1 point on STS-B. The performance difference on QQP is significant, with an absolute improvement of 4.2% over single-task BiLSTM + ELMo + Attn.
Classification Finally, we also evaluate two different text classification tasks. The Corpus
of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) [65] contains expert judgments on whether a sentence is grammatically correct or not and tests the innate linguistic bias of trained models. The Stanford Sentiment
Treebank (SST-2) [54], on the other hand, is a standard binary classification task. Our model achieves
a score of 45.4 on CoLA, which is a particularly large jump from the previous best result of 35.0 and shows the innate linguistic bias that our model has learned. The model also achieves an accuracy of 91.3%
on SST-2, which is competitive with state-of-the-art results. We also achieve an overall score of
72.8 on the GLUE benchmark, which is significantly better than the previous best of 68.9.

Semantic Similarity Semantic similarity ( OR paraphrase detection ) tasks involve predicting whether two sentences are semantically equivalent OR not . The challenges lie in recognizing rephrasing of concepts , understanding negation , and handling syntactic ambiguity . We use three datasets for this task – the Microsoft Paraphrase corpus ( MRPC ) [ 14 ] ( collected from news sources ) , the Quora Question Pairs ( QQP ) dataset [ 9 ] , and the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark ( STS-B ) [ 6 ] . We obtain state-of-the-art results on two of the three semantic similarity tasks ( Table 4 ) with a 1 point absolute gain on STS-B . The performance delta on QQP is significant , with a 4.2 % absolute improvement over Single-task BiLSTM + ELMo + Attn . Classification Finally , we also evaluate on two different text classification tasks . The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability ( CoLA ) [ 65 ] contains expert sagacity on whether a sentence is grammatical OR not , and tests the innate linguistic bias of trained mould . The Stanford Sentiment Treebank ( SST-2 ) [ 54 ] , on the other hand , is a standard binary classification task . Our model obtains an score of 45.4 on CoLA , which is an specially big jump over the premature best result of 35.0 , showcasing the innate linguistic bias learned by our model . The model also achieves 91.3 % accuracy on SST-2 , which is competitive with the state-of-the-art results . We also achieve an overall score of 72.8 on the GLUE benchmark , which is significantly better than the premature best of 68.9 . 6 Table 4 : Semantic similarity and classification results , comparing our model with current state-of-theart methods .

All task evaluations in this table were done using the GLUE benchmark. We use three datasets for this
task – the Microsoft Paraphrase corpus (MRPC) [14] (collected from news sources), the Quora
Question Pairs (QQP) dataset [9], and the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark (STS-B) [6]. We also achieve an overall score of
72.8 on the GLUE benchmark, which is significantly better than the previous best of 68.9. The performance delta on QQP is significant, with a 4.2% absolute
improvement over Single-task BiLSTM + ELMo + Attn. 6
Table 4: Semantic similarity and classification results, comparing our model with current state-of-theart methods. The challenges lie in recognizing rephrasing of
concepts, understanding negation, and handling syntactic ambiguity. Semantic Similarity Semantic similarity (or paraphrase detection) tasks involve predicting whether
two sentences are semantically equivalent or not. Our model obtains
an score of 45.4 on CoLA, which is an especially big jump over the previous best result of 35.0,
showcasing the innate linguistic bias learned by our model. (mc= Mathews
correlation, acc=Accuracy, pc=Pearson correlation) Classification Finally, we also evaluate on two different text classification tasks. The Stanford Sentiment
Treebank (SST-2) [54], on the other hand, is a standard binary classification task. The model also achieves 91.3% accuracy
on SST-2, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art results. We obtain state-of-the-art results on two of the three semantic similarity tasks (Table 4) with a 1
point absolute gain on STS-B. The Corpus
of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) [65] contains expert judgements on whether a sentence is
grammatical or not, and tests the innate linguistic bias of trained models.

Analysis
Impact of number of transferred layers We observed the impact of transferring a variable number of layers from the unsupervised pre-training to the supervised target task. Figure 2 (left) illustrates the
performance of our approach on MultiNLI and RACE as a function of the number of transferred layers.
We observe the standard result that transferring embeddings improves performance and that each
transformer layer provides further benefits of up to 9% for full transfer to MultiNLI. This shows that
each layer in the pre-trained model contains useful features for solving target tasks.
Figure 2: (left) Impact of transferring an increasing number of layers from the pre-trained language model to RACE and MultiNLI. (right) Plot showing the evolution of zero-shot performance on
different tasks as a function of LM pre-training updates. The performance per task is normalized between
a randomly estimated baseline and the current state of the art with a single model.
Zero-shot behavior We want to better understand why pre-training transformers with language models is effective. One hypothesis is that the underlying generative model learns to perform many of the tasks we evaluated to improve its language modeling ability, and that the more structured attentional memory of the transformer compared to LSTMs helps with transfer. We have developed a number of heuristic solutions that use the underlying generative model to perform tasks without supervised fine-tuning. We visualize the effectiveness of these heuristic solutions over the course of generative pre-training in Fig. 2 (right). We observe that the performance of these heuristics is stable and increases steadily over the course of training, suggesting that generative pre-training supports learning a variety of task-relevant features. We also observe that the LSTM has higher variance in its zero-shot performance, suggesting that the inductive bias of the Transformer architecture supports transfer. For CoLA (linguistic acceptance), examples are scored as the average token log-likelihood that the generative model assigns, and predictions are made by thresholding. For SST-2 (sentiment analysis), we append the token “very” to each example and restrict the language model’s output distribution to only the words “positive” and “negative,” and guess the token it assigns the higher probability to as a prediction. For RACE (question answering), we select the answer to which the generative model assigns the highest average token-log probability when conditional on the document and the question. For DPRD [46] (Winograd schemes), we replace the definite pronoun with the two possible referents and predict the resolution for which the generative model assigns the higher average token-log probability to the rest of the sequence after the replacement.

Ablation Studies We conduct three different ablation studies (Table 5). First, we examine the
performance of our method without the auxiliary objective LM during fine-tuning. We observe that
the auxiliary objective helps on the NLI tasks and QQP. Overall, the trend suggests that larger datasets
benefit from the auxiliary objective, but smaller datasets do not. Second, we analyze the effect of the
Transformer by comparing it to a single-layer LSTM with 2048 units using the same framework. We
observe an average score drop of 5.6 when we use the LSTM instead of the Transformer. The LSTM only outperforms the Transformer on one dataset – MRPC. Finally, we also compare with our Transformer architecture trained directly on supervised target tasks without pretraining. We observe that the lack of pretraining affects the performance on all tasks, resulting in a 14.8% drop compared to our full model. 6 Conclusion
We have introduced a framework to achieve strong natural language understanding with a single task-agnostic model through generative pre-training and discriminatory fine-tuning. By pre-training on a diverse corpus with long connected text segments, our model acquires significant world knowledge and the ability to handle long-range dependencies, which is then successfully transferred to solving discriminatory tasks such as question answering, evaluating semantic similarity, determining implications, and text classification, improving the state of the art on 9 of the 12 datasets we studied. Using unsupervised (pre-)training to improve performance on discriminatory tasks has long been an important goal of machine learning research. Our work suggests that it is indeed possible to achieve significant performance gains and provides clues as to which models (transformers) and datasets (text with long-range dependencies) perform best with this approach. We hope this will help
enable new research into unsupervised learning for both natural language understanding and other areas,
and further improve our understanding of how and when unsupervised learning works.

We
observe a 5.6 average score drop when using the LSTM instead of the Transformer. First, we examine the
performance of our method without the auxiliary LM objective during fine-tuning. We observe that the lack
of pre-training hurts performance across all the tasks, resulting in a 14.8% decrease compared to our
full model. 6 Conclusion
We introduced a framework for achieving strong natural language understanding with a single
task-agnostic model through generative pre-training and discriminative fine-tuning. Our work suggests that achieving significant
performance gains is indeed possible, and offers hints as to what models (Transformers) and data sets
(text with long range dependencies) work best with this approach. We hope that this will help enable
new research into unsupervised learning, for both natural language understanding and other domains,
further improving our understanding of how and when unsupervised learning works We observe that
the auxiliary objective helps on the NLI tasks and QQP. Ablation studies We perform three different ablation studies (Table 5). Finally, we also compare with our transformer
architecture directly trained on supervised target tasks, without pre-training. Overall, the trend suggests that larger datasets
benefit from the auxiliary objective but smaller datasets do not. Second, we analyze the effect of the
Transformer by comparing it with a single layer 2048 unit LSTM using the same framework. By pre-training
on a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text our model acquires significant world
knowledge and ability to process long-range dependencies which are then successfully transferred to
solving discriminative tasks such as question answering, semantic similarity assessment, entailment
determination, and text classification, improving the state of the art on 9 of the 12 datasets we
study. The LSTM only
outperforms the Transformer on one dataset – MRPC. Using unsupervised (pre-)training to boost performance on discriminative tasks has long
been an important goal of Machine Learning research.

Abstract. We propose a prototype-based federated learning method designed for embedding networks in classification or verification tasks.
We focus on scenarios where each client has data from a single class.
The main challenge is to develop an embedding network that can distinguish between different classes while respecting privacy constraints.
Sharing real class prototypes with the server or other clients could potentially compromise confidential information. To address this issue, we propose a proxy class prototype that is shared by the clients instead of the real class prototype. Our approach generates proxy class prototypes by linearly combining them with their nearest neighbors. This technique hides the real class prototype and allows the clients to learn discriminatory embedding networks. We compare our method with alternative techniques, such as adding random Gaussian noise and using random selection with cosine similarity constraints. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of our approach against gradient inversion attacks and introduce a prototype leakage measure. This measure quantifies the extent of private information revealed when sharing the proposed proxy class prototype. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of our approach. Our proposed federated learning from scratch method demonstrates its effectiveness through empirical results on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2. Keywords: Federated Learning · Contrastive Learning · User Verification 1 Introduction The problem of training embedding networks has been widely studied due to its applicability to various tasks such as identification, verification, retrieval, and clustering [3,30,32,36,37,40,43]. These networks are typically trained using a loss function that simultaneously minimizes the distance between instance embeddings of the same class and maximizes the distance between instance embeddings of different classes. In recent years, deep neural networks trained on large datasets have been used to obtain nonlinear embeddings [7, 11, 14, 47]. However, collecting large and high-quality data to train deep networks for real-world applications remains expensive [45, 46, 48].

1 Introduction
The problem of training embedding networks has been widely studied due to
its applicability in various tasks, such as identification, verification, retrieval,
and clustering [3,30,32,36,37,40,43]. In recent years, deep neural networks
trained on large datasets have been employed to obtain nonlinear embeddings
[7, 11, 14, 47]. Our focus is on scenarios where each client has data from a single class. Furthermore, we evaluate the
robustness of our approach against gradient inversion attacks and introduce a measure for prototype leakage. We propose a prototype-based federated learning method
designed for embedding networks in classification or verification tasks. However, collecting large and high-quality data for training deep
networks remains expensive for real-world applications [45, 46, 48]. The main challenge is to develop an embedding network that can distinguish between different classes while adhering to privacy constraints.

One approach to solve the data collection problem is to train the model using a federated learning framework. In this framework, a global model is iteratively updated by aggregating local models without requiring direct access to local data [2,20,22,29,35]. In particular, we consider a scenario where each client can only access data of one target class and cannot share embeddings with the server or other clients. In such a setting, it becomes difficult for each client to learn an embedding network that distinguishes different classes in the embedding space due to the lack of information about other clients' class prototypes. Consequently, the learned class prototypes might collapse into a single embedding. The problem of training embedding networks in a federated setup has been recently studied in various settings. Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS) [42] learns an embedding network for multi-class classification in the federated setup where each client can only access positive labels. In this method, client embeddings are shared with the server and a regularization term is applied to increase the pairwise distances between the embeddings. However, the server is assumed not to share client class prototypes with others. Unfortunately, attackers with access to the server can perform a model inversion attack [10, 12, 18] to reconstruct inputs using a pre-trained model and a target identity related to the class prototype. Another recent approach is Federated User Verification (FedUV) [16], which uses predefined codewords that ensure a minimum distance between class prototypes. Consequently, FedUV does not require sharing class prototypes with the server. However, it does not consider the similarity of clients' data while training the embeddings. To solve this problem, we propose a federated learning framework where each client updates its local model with a contrastive learning loss to minimize within-class variance and maximize between-class variance. This approach requires sharing class prototypes with other clients, potentially exposing security-sensitive information. Instead, we introduce a method called FedHide, where
clients share proxy class prototypes generated by linear combination with
their nearest neighbors to reduce the disclosure of security-sensitive information.
We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of FedHide on
non-convex targets. Empirically, our approach reduces the disclosure of sensitive embeddings to other users while maintaining discriminatory
performance across datasets such as CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2 datasets.

Instead, we introduce a method called FedHide, in which
clients share proxy class prototypes generated by linearly combining them with
their nearest neighbors to reduce the expose of security-sensitive information. In such a setting, it becomes challenging for each
client to learn an embedding network that discriminates different classes in the
embedding space due to the lack of information about other clients’ class prototypes. Another recent approach is Federated User Verification (FedUV) [16],
which proposes to use predefined codewords guaranteeing a minimum distance
between class prototypes. Consequently, the learned class prototypes might collapse into a single
embedding. The problem of training embedding networks in a federated setup has been recently explored in various settings. In this method, client
embeddings are shared with the server, and a regularization term is applied to
increase pairwise distances between embeddings. To address this problem, we propose a federated learning framework in which
each client updates its local model with a contrastive learning loss to minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance. However, it does not take into account the similarity
of clients’ data during training embeddings. Consequently, FedUV does not require sharing class
prototypes with the server. Empirically, our approach reduces the exposure of sensitive embeddings to other users while maintaining discriminating
performance across datasets such as CIFAR-100, VoxCeleb1, and VGGFace2
datasets. This approach requires sharing class prototypes with other clients, potentially exposing securitysensitive information. Unfortunately, adversaries with
access to the server may perform a model-inversion attack [10, 12, 18] to reconstruct inputs using a pretrained model and a target identity related to the class
prototype. Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS)
[42] learns an embedding network for multi-class classification in the federated
setup, where each client has access to only positive labels. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of FedHide when
dealing with non-convex objectives. Specifically, we consider a scenario where each client
has access to data from only one target class and cannot share embeddings with
the server or other clients. However, the server is assumed
not to share client class prototypes with others. One approach to address the data collection problem is to train the model
using a federated learning framework. In this framework, a global model is iteratively updated by aggregating local models without requiring direct access to
local data [2,20,22,29,35].

In this paper, we consider a scenario where each client has access to data from only one class. In such cases, we can naively apply one-class classification approaches such as DeepSVDD (Deep Support Vector Data Description) [34] and DROCC (Deep Robust One-Class Classification) [13]. In DeepSVDD, an embedding network is trained by minimizing the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the instance embeddings of the data. By minimizing the volume of the hypersphere, the network extracts common variation factors with the goal of closely mapping data points to the center of the hypersphere. To prevent hypersphere collapse, DeepSVDD uses neural networks without bias terms or bounded activation functions. Motivated by the observation that data from special classes lie on a low-dimensional manifold, DROCC introduces a discriminatory component. This component generates anomalous data, which is then used to train the embedded network.
However, the focus of this paper is to find a way to leverage other clients' information without compromising privacy.
Federated Learning (FL) is a method for training a model across distributed edge devices (clients) without sharing local data information.

Federated learning (FL) is a method for training a model across distributed
edge (client) devices without sharing local data information. This component generates anomalous data, which are then used to train the embedding network. By minimizing the hypersphere’s volume, the
FedHide: Federated Learning by Hiding in the Neighbors 3
network extracts common factors of variation, aiming to closely map data points
to the center of the hypersphere. However, the focus of this paper lies in finding a way to utilize other clients’
information without compromising privacy. Motivated by the observation that data from special classes lie on a low-dimensional
manifold, DROCC introduces a discriminative component. In such cases, we can naively apply one-class classification approaches, such as DeepSVDD (Deep Support Vector Data Description) [34] and
DROCC (Deep Robust One-Class Classification) [13]. In this paper, we consider a scenario where each client has access to data from
only one class. To prevent hypersphere collapse, DeepSVDD
uses neural networks without bias terms or bounded activation functions. In DeepSVDD, it trains an
embedding network by minimizing the volume of a hypersphere that encloses the
instance embeddings of the data.

In each round of the learning process, the server sends the current global model to selected clients. After the clients update their local models using local data from the shared global model, these local models are uploaded to the server. Finally, the server aggregates the local models to update the global model. A popular FL algorithm is Federated Averaging (FedAvg) [29]. However, in our scenario, where each client can only access data of one class, it is not appropriate to share the parameters of the output layer, called the class prototype, with other clients. The class prototype contains client-specific information and could be exploited in a gradient inversion attack [12, 18]. Such an attack reconstructs an input by minimizing the discrepancy between the gradient of a reconstructed input image and the gradient uploaded by a client. This shows that gradient sharing does not guarantee client privacy in the context of federated learning. We will demonstrate the robustness of our method against this attack. There are FL methods that focus on solving problems where data is not identically distributed among clients. In FedProx [26], local updates are constrained by the L2 norm distance. SCAFFOLD [20] corrects local updates by variance reduction. MOON [25] is a model-level contrastive FL method that corrects local updates by maximizing the match of the representation learned by the current local model with the representation learned by the global model. However, these methods do not specifically address our scenario where there is a single class per client, which is an extremely non-iid case. There are several works that address the extremely non-iid case. FedAwS [42] trains an embedding network for multi-class classification in the federated environment. Each client has access to only positive data. The loss function of FedAwS is based on a contrastive loss and aims to minimize the within-class variance while maximizing the between-class variance. At each client, a similar loss as DeepSVDD is optimized to train a local model. Each client then uploads its local model and a class prototype to the server. Instead of sharing the class prototype directly with other clients, FedAwS optimizes a regularization term to distribute the class prototypes. However, FedAwS still requires sharing class prototypes with the server, which may raise privacy concerns. FedFace [1] is proposed for collaborative learning of face recognition models based on FedAwS. It shows good performance on face recognition benchmarks. However, it requires a well-pretrained model as an initial global model and still faces privacy issues. FedUV [16] aims to eliminate the sharing requirement

Class prototypes with the server in federated learning of user verification models.
The authors propose to use predefined codewords of an error-correcting code as
class prototypes. This approach enables clients to jointly train user verification models without compromising privacy. However, FedUV has a limitation of
modeling the similarity between clients in the embedding space because the codewords
are predefined without considering local data properties.
Our proposed method is related to prototype-based federated learning approaches. In FedProto [38], each client has a different embedding network and
does not share model parameters but only class prototypes. This approach
avoids compromising private information. In FedPCL [39], clients jointly learn to
fuse representations generated by multiple fixed pre-trained models and use a prototype-wise contrastive learning approach. FedNH [8] proposes to use initial class prototypes that are evenly distributed in the latent space and to smoothly feed class information into these prototypes. However, they do not maintain global embedding networks, and providing a global embedding network to unseen clients is not feasible. ProtoFL [21] is a method that aims to improve the representation performance of a global model and reduce communication costs. However, it requires a commercially available model and dataset on the server. 3 Method 3.1 Federated learning based on contrastive learning loss with proxy prototypes We propose a FL framework in which clients update their local models using contrastive learning loss to minimize the intra-class variance while maximizing the inter-class variance. Instead of sharing the real class prototype that represents the instance embeddings of local data, we share a proxy class prototype. This approach reduces the disclosure of security-related information and
enables us to learn an embedding network that can operate between different

Image classification. For image classification experiments, we use the
CIFAR-100 dataset [23], which includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 100
classes. Our training setup includes 100 clients, each with 500 images from the
same class. The remaining 100 images per class are reserved for testing. During
training, we apply random horizontal flips and rotations for data augmentation.
10 H. Park and S. Yun
Our ResNet18-based embedding network is trained for 100,000 rounds, with
0.1 percent of clients selected in each round. In the testing phase, we
calculate the classification accuracy using the global model on the test set. We assume
that the server has access to the clients’ test sets.
Speaker verification. For speaker verification experiments, we use the VoxCeleb1 dataset [31], which includes over 100,000 utterances from 1,251 celebrities. Following the usual split, we use 1,211 clients for training. Each client owns approximately 122 waveforms associated with the same identity. The remaining 40 speakers are used to evaluate the verification performance in terms of equal error rate (EER) for 37,611 test pairs from the official test list. During the training phase, we randomly clip a 2-s time segment from each utterance to extract Mel-scaled spectrograms using a Hamming window of 25 ms length and 10 ms jump size. These 40-dimensional Mel filter banks serve as inputs to a speaker embedding network. Specifically, we use a modified Fast ResNet-34 [6] for the speaker embedding network. The embedded network is trained for

Following the standard split, we employ 1,211 clients for training. Our training setup involves 100 clients, each with 500 images from the
same class. The remaining 100 images per class are reserved for testing. Image Classification. For speaker verification experiments, we utilize the
VoxCeleb1 dataset [31], which comprises over 100,000 utterances from 1,251
celebrities. During
training, we apply random horizontal flips and rotations for data augmentation. We assume that
the server has access to the clients’ test sets. The remaining 40 speakers are used to evaluate verification performance
in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER) for 37,611 test pairs from the official test list. Speaker Verification. For image classification experiments, we utilize the
CIFAR-100 dataset [23], which comprises 60,000 32x32 color images across 100
classes. In the test phase, we calculate
classification accuracy using the global model on the test set. 10 H. Park and S. Yun
Our ResNet18-based embedding network is trained for 100,000 rounds, with
0.1 fraction of clients selected at each round. These 40-dimensional Mel filterbanks serve
as inputs to a speaker embedding network. Each client possesses approximately 122 waveforms associated with the same
identity. During the training phase, we randomly crop a 2-second temporal segment from
each utterance to extract mel-scaled spectrograms using a Hamming window
of 25ms length and 10ms hop size. The embedding network is

ResNet-34 [6] for the speaker embedding network.

Here is the transcript content:

Notably, we do not use data augmentation techniques in this experiment.
To calculate the EER during the testing phase, we cut out ten 3-second time segments from each utterance pair and calculate the averages for all segment pairs.
Face Verification. For face verification experiments, we use the VGGFace2 dataset [4], which includes 3.31 million images of 9,131 identities. According to the standard split, we use 8,631 clients for training. Each client owns 365 images associated with the same identity. The remaining 500 clients are used to measure the validation verification performance in terms of EER. We generated 338,430 test pairs to calculate the EER, similar to the VoxCeleb1 evaluation.
During the training phase, we first detect faces using a pre-trained FaceNet [36].
Finally, we use 64x64 scaled face images as inputs to a face embedding network. Our training process involves a MobileFaceNet-based embedding network trained for 400,000 rounds, where 0.001 of the clients are selected in each round. We compare our FedHide method with FedGN, FedCS, and FedAwS. Instead of batch normalization (BN) [19], we use group normalization (GN) [41] because we observed that BN does not perform well in non-iid data settings for federated learning [17]. All models generate L 2-normalized 512-dimensional embedding vectors. Clients are selected in a round-robin manner, and at each client, the local model is updated with a single iteration. Across all datasets, we use a minibatch size of 16, a negative loss weight of ? = 10 and a learning rate of 0.1 with the SGD optimizer. These hyperparameters were initially determined by a grid search for the FedAwS experiments. Our reported results represent
averages of 3 runs with different random numbers achieved by tuning the hyperparameters. We conducted our experiments using PyTorch [33] and NVIDIA
RTX A5000 GPUs. For a single configuration with one GPU, the image classification, speaker verification, and face verification experiments take about
21 hours, 24 hours, and 80 hours, respectively.

We conducted our experiments using PyTorch [33] and NVIDIA

averages from 3 runs with different random seeds, achieved by adjusting hyperparameters. = 10, and a learning rate of
0.1 with the SGD optimizer. Our training process involves a MobileFaceNet-based embedding network
trained for 400,000 rounds, where 0.001 fraction of clients are selected at each
round. Face Verification. To calculate the EER during the test phase, we crop ten 3-second temporal
segments from each utterance pair and compute the average scores across all
segment pairs. During the training phase, we first detect faces using a pretrained FaceNet [36]. We compare our FedHide method with FedGN, FedCS, and FedAwS. Finally, we use 64x64 resized face images as inputs to a face embedding network. Following the standard split, we employ 8,631 clients for training. For a single configuration using a GPU, the image classification, speaker verification, and face verification experiments take approximately
21 hours, 24 hours, and 80 hours, respectively. These hyperparameters were initially determined

Results
Figure 3 illustrates the experimental results of the proposed methods on the
CIFAR-100 dataset. In Figure 3a, 3b and 3c, the horizontal axis represents the
FL round while the vertical axis corresponds to the classification accuracy. In general, the accuracy improves with increasing number of rounds. Figure 3a shows the accuracy curves for FedGN with different hyperparameters where
? ? {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. The performance improves as ? decreases. In Figure 3b,
we observe the accuracy curves for FedCS with different hyperparameters where
cos(?) ? {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. The performance improves with increasing cosine similarities. Figure 3c shows the accuracy curves for FedHide with different hyperparameters where ? ? {0.1, 0.01} and K ? {5, 10, 20}. ? = 0.1 shows faster
convergence than ? = 0.01. Also, lower K values ​​lead to faster convergence compared to higher values. Figure 3d shows a scatter plot for FedGN,
FedCS, FedHide, and FedAwS. The horizontal axis represents prototype leaks,
while the vertical axis represents the accuracy in the last round. The results in the upper left corner indicate high accuracy and low prototype leaks. In particular, FedHide methods effectively reduce prototype leaks while maintaining similar accuracy.

In Table 2, we visualize reconstructed images using a gradient inversion attack [12] under different proxy prototype generation methods with different hyperparameters for four CIFAR-100 samples. For each image sample, we reconstruct the image from gradients obtained from the initial and trained ResNet-18 models using our proposed loss function (Equation 1). Additionally, we report the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) score [18, 44], with lower values ​​indicating greater privacy leaks. We used official PyTorch implementations for image reconstruction from gradient 1 and LPIPS score 2. In particular, reconstruction with gradients from an untrained model results in higher privacy leaks (lower LPIPS) compared to reconstruction from the trained model, since trained models generally yield gradients with low strength. Furthermore, we observe that the hyperparameters of proxy prototype generation methods such as ?, ?, ?, K can effectively control the degree of privacy leakage. Table 3 shows the cosine similarities between real class prototypes and proxy class prototypes w¯
T
c wc in the last round of CIFAR-100 training. In the case of FedGN, the average cosine similarities decrease with increasing ?. In the case of FedCS, the cosine similarity used to generate proxy class prototypes is naturally consistent with the average cosine similarities. In the case of FedHide, ? = 0.1 shows higher cosine similarities than ? = 0.01. Moreover, the average cosine similarities decrease with increasing K as expected. Figure 4 shows scatterplots for the FedAwS, FedGN, FedCS, and FedHide methods on the VoxCeleb1 and VGGFace2 datasets. The horizontal axis represents the prototype leakage, while the vertical axis represents the EER in the last round. The results in the lower left corner indicate both low EER and low prototype leakage. In particular, the FedHide method effectively reduces prototype leakage
while maintaining a similar EER to FedAwS. We use the same hyperparameters
as in the CIFAR-100 experiments, except for the K value in the VGGFace2 dataset. Detailed numerical results can be found in Table 4.

In Table 2 , we visualize reconstructed images using a gradient inversion attack [ 12 ] under different proxy prototype generation methods with varying hyperparameters for four CIFAR-100 samples . For each image sample , we reconstruct the image from gradients obtained by the initial and trained ResNet-18 models using our proposed loss function ( Eq . 1 ) . Additionally , we report the learned perceptual image patch similarity ( LPIPS ) score ampere-second [ 18 , 44 ] , where lower values indicate greater privacy leakage . We utilized official PyTorch implementations for image reconstruction from gradients 1 and LPIPS scoring 2 . Notably , reconstruction using gradients from an untrained model results in higher privacy leakage ( lower LPIPS ) compared to reconstruction from adenine the trained model , as trained models generally yield low-magnitude gradients . Furthermore , we observe that the hyperparameters of proxy prototype generation methods such as ? , ? , ? , K can effectively control the privacy leakage level . Table 3 cos presents the cosine similarities between true class prototypes and proxy class prototypes w¯ T c wc in the last round of CIFAR-100 training . In the FedGN case , as ? increases , the average cosine similarities decrease . In the FedCS case , the cosine similarity used for generating proxy class prototypes aligns naturally with the average cosine similarities . In the FedHide case , ? = 0.1 shows higher cosine similarities than ? = 0.01 . Additionally , as K increases , the average cosine similarities decrease as expected . Figure 4 displays scatter plots for FedAwS , FedGN , FedCS , and FedHide methods on the VoxCeleb1 and VGGFace2 datasets .

This paper has some limitations. First, the FedHide method requires empirical hyperparameter search. We plan to explore ways to determine the prototype-dependent optimal number of nearest neighbors (K). Second, although we demonstrated reduced prototype leakage while empirically maintaining accuracy,

did not provide privacy guarantee analysis. Finally, the proposed method
might be vulnerable to adaptive attackers who continuously monitor the communication channel and try to recover the real prototype by solving linear inverse
problems [24].
5 Conclusion
We proposed FedHide, a federated learning method for embedding networks in
classification and verification tasks. In this approach, each client has access to
data of only one class and cannot share a class prototype representing
local private data with the server or other clients. In the FedHide framework,
clients update their local models using a contrastive learning loss to minimize
intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance. This was achieved by
using proxy class prototypes that can be shared by other clients. These
proxy class prototypes are generated by linear combination with their nearest neighbors. In our comparison experiments, FedHide showed the best
performance in terms of low prototype leakage while maintaining high accuracy
or low EER. Additionally, we provided a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate
of FedHide when dealing with non-convex targets.

Abstract. Advances in rendering have led to tremendous growth in texture resources, including resolution, complexity, and novel texture components, but this growth in data volume has not been offset by advances in compression. Meanwhile, neural image compression (NIC) has evolved significantly and shown promising results, but the proposed methods cannot be directly adapted to neural texture compression. First, texture compression requires on-demand and real-time random-access decoding during parallel rendering (e.g., block texture decompression on GPUs). Furthermore, NIC neither supports multi-resolution (MIP-level) reconstruction nor is it able to efficiently jointly compress different sets of texture channels. In this work, we present a novel approach to texture set compression that integrates traditional GPU texture representation and NIC techniques and is designed to enable random access and support texture sets with many channels. To achieve this goal,
we propose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that uses a convolutional encoder to capture detailed information in a latent bottleneck space, and on the decoder side, we use a fully connected network whose inputs are sampled latent features plus position information for a given texture coordinate and mip level. This latent data is defined to allow
a simplified access to multi-resolution data by simply changing the scan steps. Experimental results show that this approach provides much better results than traditional texture compression and a
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method using neural networks.

Meanwhile Neural Image Compression (NIC) has advanced significantly and shown promising results, but the proposed methods cannot be directly adapted to neural texture compression. block texture decompression

1 Introduction
The rapid growth of graphics and gaming industries hinges on new technologies
that create increasingly photorealistic scenes, a goal that heavily relies on texturing. First, texture compression requires on-demand and real-time decoding with random access during parallel rendering (e.g. Abstract. To achieve this goal,
we propose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that employs a convolutional encoder to capture detailed information in a bottleneck-latent
space, and at decoder side we utilize a fully connected network, whose inputs are sampled latent features plus positional information, for a given
texture coordinate and mip level. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides much better results than conventional texture compression, and
significant improvement over the latest method using neural networks. This latent data is defined to enable
simplified access to multi-resolution data by simply changing the scanning strides. Advances in rendering have led to tremendous growth in texture assets, including resolution, complexity, and novel textures components, but this growth in data volume has not been matched by advances
in its compression. Additionally, NIC does not support multi-resolution reconstruction (mip-levels), nor does it have the ability to efficiently jointly
compress different sets of texture channels.

The appearance of the object surface should change depending on the lighting and viewing position [18,35]. Texturing gives surfaces realistic properties such as roughness, smoothness, reflectivity, and intricate patterns, allowing for a faithful recreation of various materials such as wood, metal, fabric, glass, or concrete. This contributes significantly to the overall realism of rendered scenes. However, achieving this level of realism requires large amounts of data, which can impact download times, rendering speed, and local storage. While the amount of data could be reduced using some widely used texture compression methods, these are comparatively limited and inefficient [41]. The development of better compression methods has been very slow due to several technical difficulties. In computer graphics, textures often appear enlarged and can have large sizes with multiple components. These are organized in a multi-resolution mipmap pyramid, which plays a crucial role in texture resampling. Mipmaps can be visualized as an image pyramid for efficient texture filtering, where each mip level represents a filtered version of the texture corresponding to a specific image pixel to texture pixel ratio. However, only a small portion of this data is needed for a given scene view, and thus efficient texture compression methods are essential to decompress only the required components. This compression must also support asynchronous parallelized execution, so that each rendering thread can independently access the values ​​required for its tasks at the required position and resolution. This requirement eliminates some of the most efficient techniques for compressing 2D images and videos, which exploit large scale dependencies, statistical consistency, and serialized entropy coding, and thus cannot be independently decompressed. A further complication is that rendering is fully programmable, allowing the creation of an increasing variety of texture components. Therefore, the design of

Methods that can optimally compress all new texture types cannot be effectively performed manually, but can be automated via learning-based techniques. Neural network-based compression methods have been proposed and demonstrated to be competitive with conventional methods for images and videos. However, these codecs are not designed for, nor can they be easily modified to support, random access and other rendering requirements. Unlike digital image compression, which involves compressing an entire image at a fixed resolution and typically processes a fixed number of color channels (e.g., 3 channels for RGB or YUV), texture compression must exploit multiple levels of redundancy in the texture components. This paper addresses these complexities by proposing new learning-based methods and neural network architectures specifically designed for texture compression and rendering. 2 Motivation: Conventional texture compression achieves random access through block-wise vector quantization. These techniques often exploit both spatial and cross-channel correlations. However, their limitation is that they can only compress textures with up to “four channels”. In contrast, modern renderers typically exploit a wider range of material properties, including color channels as well as other channels for normal maps, height maps, ambient occlusion, glossiness, roughness, and other information related to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). These channels exhibit significant correlation within the texture set. This correlation arises from a combination of factors including physical material properties, geometric features, and artistic layering during material creation [15]. For example, consider Figure 3, where a texture set related to a brick wall pattern contains color channels as well as other channels for normal maps, combined ambient occlusion (AO) and roughness maps, and displacement maps. In addition, in computer graphics, textures are stored at different resolutions, commonly referred to as mipmaps, for efficient rendering. As [44] shows, there is significant redundancy at different scales. In their pioneering work, Vaidyanathan et al. [41] introduced a novel neural texture compression scheme. Their approach exploits spatial redundancies across all channels of a texture set and across different mip levels. This was achieved by compressing the entire texture set, including all channels and mip levels, simultaneously. Their autodecoder framework [31] uses a pair of feature pyramids called girds to represent the texture set across all mip levels. Each pyramid level is responsible for reconstructing texels at one or more mip levels, and features stored at a given pyramid level can be shared across multiple mip levels. This innovative method significantly improves the efficiency and quality of texture compression in texture representation. In our analysis, we found redundancies within the feature pyramids that negatively impacted compression performance. In particular, as texture resolution increased, this redundancy became more evident.

They achieved this by
compressing the entire texture set, including all channels and mip levels simultaneously. This innovative method significantly advances texture compression
efficiency and quality in texture representation. These channels exhibit significant correlation within the texture set. This paper addresses these complexities by proposing new
learning-based methods and neural-network architectures specifically designed
for texture compression and rendering. This correlation arises from a combination of factors, including physical material properties, geometric features, and artistic layering during material authoring [15]. Unlike digital image compression, which focuses on compressing an entire image at a fixed resolution and
typically handles a fixed number of color channels (e.g., 3 channels for RGB or
YUV), texture compression must exploit multiple levels of redundancy in the
texture components. 2 Motivation
Conventional texture compression achieves random access by employing blockwise vector quantization. Furthermore, in computer graphics, for efficient rendering textures are stored
at different resolutions, commonly referred to as mipmaps. Their autodecoder framework [31] utilizes a pair of feature pyramids,
referred to as Girds, to represent the texture set throughout all mip levels. Neural network-based compression methods have been proposed and demonstrated to be competitive with conventional methods for images and video. However, these codecs are not designed for, nor can they be easily modified to support
random access and other rendering requirements. In contrast, modern renderers commonly utilize a broader range of material properties, including color channels as
well as other channels for normal maps, height maps, ambient occlusion, glossiness, roughness, and other information related to the Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Function (BRDF). In our analysis, we identified redundancy within the feature pyramids, which
adversely affected compression performance. methods that can optimally compress all new texture types cannot be done
effectively manually, but can be automated via learning-based techniques. [41], introduced a novel neural
texture compression scheme. For instance, consider Figure 3, where a texture set related to a brick wall pattern includes color channels as well as other channels for normal map, combined
ambient occlusion (ao) and roughness map, and displacement map. These techniques often leverage both spatial and crosschannel correlations. In their pioneering work, Vaidyanathan et al. Each
pyramid level is responsible for reconstructing texels at one or more mip levels,
and features stored at a particular pyramid level can be shared across multiple
mip levels. Particularly, as texture resolution
increased, this redundancy became more pronounced As shown by [44] there
are significant redundancies at different scales. However, their limitation lies in the fact that they can only
compress textures with up to “four channels”. Their approach exploits spatial redundancies across
all channels of a texture set and across different mip levels.

In our investigation (Figure 2), we observed significant similarities between different levels of the feature pyramids, suggesting the presence of redundant data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative neural texture compression method based on an asymmetric autoencoder framework. The key contributions of our approach are as follows (see Figure 1a): 1. Asymmetric autoencoder framework: Our “Global Transformer” processes a texture set and generates representations that capture the redundancy of spatial channel resolution. The “Texture Synthesizer” then samples from these representations to reconstruct texels at specific positions and MIP levels. 2. Grid Constructor: The Global Transformer operates exclusively on the texture set at the highest resolution (MIP level 0) and maps it into a pair of single-resolution representations. These representation pairs capture high- and low-frequency features of the texture set and serve as representations across all MIP levels. 3. Raster sampler: To facilitate texel reconstruction from different MIP levels,
we sample the features stored in the representations with different steps.
By exploiting redundancies across pixels, different channels and MIP levels,
our method improves texture compression while maintaining quality.

3.1 Conventional texture compression
Texture compression serves as a special technique for compressing texture maps in 3D computer graphics rendering systems. Unlike conventional image compression algorithms designed for general-purpose images, texture compression algorithms specifically target random-access scenarios [6]. The main challenge is to enable fast random access to decompressed texture data, since a renderer accesses texels in an unpredictable order. In particular, texture compression tolerates asymmetric encoding and decoding speeds, since the encoding process typically occurs only once during application build [6].
Most conventional texture compression algorithms involve lossy vector quantization of small, fixed-size pixel blocks into equal-sized blocks of encoding bits.
These algorithms often include additional pre- and post-processing steps. For example, Block Truncation Coding (BTC) [8] is an example of a straightforward approach within this family of methods. To meet the growing demands for texture storage in real-time applications, practical texture compression systems such as S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) [43], PowerVR Texture Compression (PVRTC) [10], Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC) [36], and Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) [30] have been developed. Interestingly, these systems are still based on block-based texture compression techniques originally introduced in the late 1980s for processing RGB data. The main limitation is that existing systems can only compress textures with up to four color channels (e.g., RGB or RGBA). Moreover, they compress each mip-level separately. Consequently, they cannot fully capture correlations across all channels of a texture set and its mip-levels. 3.2 Neural compression
Neural compression uses neural networks for data compression and has attracted much attention [1–4, 12–14, 16, 17, 22–28, 32–34, 39, 40]. Among them, neural image compression (NIC) [2–4, 12, 14, 26–28, 39, 40] is very powerful and some of them have surpassed conventional image compression.
However, we cannot directly apply it to graphic texture compression due to the following limitations. First, texture compression requires random access, which can only decompress certain texels or texel blocks from a whole texture. Second, NIC methods often use entropy coding to compress the latent features, which is hardly feasible due to the nature of entropy coding as a random access variable length coding method. Third, neural image compression methods are usually designed for RGB images, which contain three channels. In contrast, graphical textures often contain multiple channels for different materials, including albedo, normal, roughness, etc. For example, in a single water bottle scenario, the materials of the bottle might contain more channels than the materials of the label attached to the bottle. A compression method that works for materials must be developed.

Interestingly, these
systems still rely on block-based texture compression techniques initially introduced in the late 1980s for handling RGB data. Secondly, NIC methods often leverage entropy coding to compress the latent features, which is hardly possible for random-access due to the
nature of entropy coding as a variable length coding method. Additionally, they compress each mip level separately. 3.2 Neural Compression
Neural compression leverages the neural networks to compress data and has attracted great attention [1–4, 12–14, 16, 17, 22–28, 32–34, 39, 40]. Practical texture compression
systems, such as S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) [43], PowerVR Texture Compression (PVRTC) [10], Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC) [36], and Adaptive
Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) [30], have been developed to address the
growing texture storage demands in real-time applications. For
instance, in one single scenario containing a bottle of water, the materials of the
bottle might contain more channels than the materials of the label attached to
the bottle. For instance, Block Truncation Coding (BTC) [8] exemplifies a straightforward approach within this family of methods. However, we can not apply them to the graphic texture compression directly due
to the following limitations. The primary limitation lies in
the fact that existing systems can only compress textures with up to four color
channels (e.g., RGB or RGBA). Consequently, they cannot fully capture correlations across all channels
of a texture set and its mip levels. Among them,
neural image compression (NIC) [2–4, 12, 14, 26–28, 39, 40] performance is very
competitive and some of them have surpassed conventional image compression. Most conventional texture compression algorithms involve lossy vector quantization of small fixed-size blocks of pixels into equally sized blocks of coding bits. 3.1 Conventional Texture Compression
Texture compression serves as a specialized technique for compressing texture
maps within 3D computer graphics rendering systems. Firstly, texture compression requires to randomaccess, which enabling to decompress only certain texels or texel blocks from
a whole texture. These algorithms often include additional pre-processing and post-processing
steps. In contrast, graphic textures often contain various channels for different materials, including albedo, normal, roughness and so on. Unlike conventional image compression algorithms, which are designed for general images, texture compression algorithms specifically target random access scenarios [6]. It requires to develop a compression method working for materials The primary
challenge lies in allowing rapid random access to decompressed texture data,
given the unpredictable order in which a renderer accesses texels. Notably, texture compression tolerates asymmetric encoding and decoding speeds, as the
encoding process typically occurs only once during application authoring [6]. Thirdly, neural
image compression methods normally are designed for the RGB images, which
contains three channels.

with different channels. Finally, neural image compression usually only needs to reconstruct the one image at the resolution of the input image, while texture compression needs to reconstruct the texture at different resolutions (MIP levels).
3.3 Implicit neural representation
In previous research, [9, 37] investigated RGB image compression by using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This MLP mapped pixel positions to RGB values ​​and transmitted the MLP weights as a code for the implicit neural representation (INR) of the image. However, overfitting such MLPs – referred to as implicit neural representations – proved difficult due to the high-frequency information inherent in natural images. [9, 37] showed that this overfitting problem could be improved by incorporating sinusoidal encodings and activations. While [9] reported a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) below 30 dB, [37] achieved a higher PSNR by leveraging meta-learning, particularly model-agnostic meta-learning [11], for initialization. However, this meta-learning approach is not directly applicable to texture compression, where a texture set may contain information beyond color and the number of channels may vary. Despite the possibility of random access, INR-based compression did not achieve high PSNR. Subsequent research by [29, 38] addressed this limitation by introducing lattice-based neural representations. These lattice-based representations form the basis for the first neural texture compression as proposed by [41]. 3.4 Neural Texture Compression In their pioneering work, Vaidyanathan et al. [41] introduced the neural texture compression (NTC) method that meets the requirements of random access. The NTC scheme exploits spatial redundancies across different mip levels and channels within a texture set. Their approach involves storing essential texel features for decompression in a pair of feature pyramids. These pyramids are optimized to minimize reconstruction loss while maintaining a specific bitrate determined by quantization levels. However, despite their effectiveness, some redundancy remains between feature pyramid levels, impacting compression performance

neural representations. 3.3 Implicit Neural Representation
In earlier research, [9, 37] explored RGB image compression by employing a
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The NTC scheme leverages spatial redundancies across different mip levels and
channels within a texture set. This MLP mapped pixel locations to RGB values and transmitted the MLP weights as a code for the Implicit Neural Representation (INR) of the image. Lastly, neural image compression typically only needs to
reconstruct the one single image at the input image resolution, while texture
compression has to reconstruct texture with different resolutions (mip levels). Their approach involves storing essential texel
features for decompression in a pair of feature pyramids. However, overfitting such MLPs—referred to as
implicit neural representations—proved challenging due to the high-frequency
information inherent in natural images. However, despite their effectiveness, there remains some redundancy between feature pyramid levels, impacting compression
performance [9, 37] demonstrated that this overfitting issue could be improved by incorporating sinusoidal encodings and activations. These grid-based representations form the foundation for
the first neural texture compression, as proposed by [41]. While [9] reported a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) below 30dB, [37]
achieved higher PSNR by leveraging meta-learning, specifically Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning [11], for initialization. 3.4 Neural Texture Compression
In their groundbreaking work, Vaidyanathan et al. [41] introduced the Neural
Texture Compression (NTC) method, which fulfills random-access requirements. However, this meta-learning approach is
not directly applicable to texture compression, where a texture set may include
information beyond color, and the number of channels can vary. with various channels. These pyramids are
optimized to minimize reconstruction loss while adhering to a specific bit rate
determined by quantization levels. Despite enabling
random access, INR-based compression fell short in achieving high PSNR.

Method
To meet the rendering requirements of texture compression, we used an
asymmetric autoencoder framework to compress the texture set T. The texture set T is
represented by a tensor of size c × h × w, where c indicates the total number of
channels of the textures in the texture set, and h and w correspond to the height and
width of the textures, respectively. Here, we assume that each texture in a texture set
has the same width and height. Similar to [41], we make no assumptions
about the channel number or the order of the textures in the texture set. For example, the normals or diffuse albedo could be mapped to arbitrary channels without affecting the compression. This is because we train a compression model
specifically for a given texture set.
Our neural texture compression consists of four main parts: (1) global transformer E, (2) grid constructors C0, C1, (3) grid samplers S0, S1, and (4) texture synthesizer
D. We discuss each part below. Figure 4 illustrates the
framework of our neural texture compression.
5.1 Experimental setups
Datasets We start by evaluating the performance of different texture compression techniques across different texture sets. Our selection includes seven
different materials, each associated with texture sets that have different
channel counts. These texture sets have a resolution of 2048×2048 texels, with channel counts ranging from 5 to 12. Notably, these public texture sets partially
match those used in a previous study by [41], as their full dataset is not publicly available. These publicly available texture sets come from
ambientCG1 and PolyHaven2.

Method To handle the rendering requirements of texture compression , we utilized an asymmetric autoencoder framework to press texture set T. Texture set T is represented by a tensor of size c × h × w , where c bespeak the total number of channels of the textures in the texture set , h and w corresponds to the height and width of the textures , respectively . Here we assume each texture in a texture set has the same width and height . Similar to [ 41 ] , we do not gain any assumptions about the channel count or the order of textures in the texture set . For example , the normals or diffuse , albedo could be mapped to any channels without having any impact on compression . This is because we train a compression model specifically for a given texture set . Our neural texture compression consists of four main parts : ( 1 ) Global transformer E , ( 2 ) Grid Constructors C0 , C1 , ( 3 ) Grid Samplers S0 , S1 and ( 4 ) Texture synthesizer D. In the follow we elaborate each part . Figure 4 illustrate the framework of our neural texture compression . 5.1 Experimental setups Datasets We commence by assessing the performance of various texture compression techniques across diverse texture sets . Our selection comprises seven distinct materials , each associated with texture sets that exhibit varying channel counts .

Our neural texture compression consists of four main parts: (1) Global transformer E, (2) Grid Constructors C0, C1, (3) Grid Samplers S0, S1 and (4) Texture
synthesizer D. In the following we elaborate each part. 5.1 Experimental setups
Datasets We commence by assessing the performance of various texture compression techniques across diverse texture sets. Method
To handle the rendering requirements of texture compression, we utilized an
asymmetric autoencoder framework to compress texture set T. Texture set T is
represented by a tensor of size c × h × w, where c indicates the total number of
channels of the textures in the texture set, h and w corresponds to the height and
width of the textures, respectively. Figure 4 illustrate the
framework of our neural texture compression. These texture sets boast a resolution of 2048×2048 texels, with channel
counts spanning from 5 to 12. Our selection comprises seven
distinct materials, each associated with texture sets that exhibit varying channel
counts. This is because we train a compression model
specifically for a given texture set. These publicly accessible texture sets are sourced from
ambientCG1 and PolyHaven2
. Here we assume each texture in a texture set
has the same width and height. Similar to [41], we do not make any assumptions
about the channel count or the order of textures in the texture set. For example, the normals or diffuse, albedo could be mapped to any channels without having any impact on compression. Notably, these public texture sets partially align
with those employed in a previous study by [41], as their complete dataset is
not publicly available.

In each subsequent phase, we increase the crop size Cs by a factor of 2 until
the texture synthesizer is able to reconstruct the complete chain of mip levels.
Our training setup uses a batch size of 4 and a learning rate (LR) of
10?4, which we decrease by a factor of 2 as we increase the crop size in each
phase. In the last phase, we train the model for 20,000 steps with an LR of 10?5.
In the earlier phases, we follow the approach proposed by [5] to replace quantization with additive uniform noise in the range
?
1
2Bi+1,
1
2Bi+1 
.
In the last phase, however, we explicitly quantize the feature values ​​using the
straight-through estimator (STE) introduced by [39]. We enforce a fixed quantization rate of Bi = 4, i = 0, 1 for all feature values ​​in the grid pair Gi and optimize exclusively for distortion. In all stages, we use the mean squared error (MSE) as the distortion metric to calculate the loss and use the Adam optimizer [20]. Table 1 shows the training stages for a 2048 × 2048 texture set and a mip-level range of m = 0, . . . , 9. Evaluation metrics We measure the rate in bits per pixel per channel (BPPC), taking into account that the total number of channels varies between different texture sets. The BPPC includes both the bits required to allocate the grid pair and the parameters specific to the text synthesizer, which is trained individually for each texture set. Throughout our evaluation, we consistently set Bi = 4 to store each grid pair Gi (where i = 0, 1). The total number of bits required to store a raster pair is given by cgi·h·w32. Here, cgi
represents the number of channels of the raster
Gi
and h × w denotes the resolution of the texture set at the zero-mip level.
In addition, the total number of bits required to store the texture synthesizer
is equal to its total number of parameters multiplied by the parameter precision. To control the bit rate, we manipulate the number of channels in the
raster pair (cgi
) and adjust the hidden layers in both the global transformer and the
texture synthesis.

To summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we also report the
Bjøntegaard delta rate (BD rate) [7]. This represents the average bitrate saving
for a fixed quality compared to a reference compression method.
Compared methods In our comparative evaluation, we evaluated our compression method together with NTC (as proposed in [41]). Since the NTC source code was not publicly available at the time of writing, we reimplemented their approach and performed evaluations on the same dataset as ours. In particular, our reimplementation closely matches the performance reported in [41], with the slight discrepancy resulting from using a subset of publicly available texture sets. Additionally, we compared the performance of our method with ASTC3. We used the same settings as described in [41] and used the “-exhaustive” flag to achieve the best quality. In particular, we used the two most aggressive
variants of ASTC, compressing 12 × 12, 10 × 10, 8 × 8, and 6 × 6 tiles.
5.2 Results
Rate-distortion performance Figure 5 shows the rate-distortion curve
with respect to PSNR for our compression method, our reimplementation of NTC
(as described in [41]), and ASTC. These methods were evaluated on the same
dataset, including the NTC results reported in [41].
As shown in Figure 5, our compression method
consistently outperforms both NTC and ASTC across all bit ranges. In particular, our approach shows a significant BD rate improvement of 40.8% compared to NTC (our reimplementation).
Although our compression is not optimized for SSIM [42], we have
included in Figure 5. Likewise, our method consistently outperforms the other methods.

5.2 Results
Rate-Distortion performance Figure 5 illustrates the rate-distortion curve
in terms of PSNR for our compression method, our re-implementation of NTC
(as described in [41]), and ASTC. This represents the average bitrate saving
for a fixed quality when compared to a reference compression method. Since the NTC source code
was not publicly available at the time of writing this paper, we re-implemented
their approach and conducted evaluations on the same dataset as ours. Although our compression is not optimized for SSIM [42], we have included
in Figure 5. Similarly, our method consistently outperforms the other methods. These methods were evaluated on the same
dataset, including the NTC results reported in [41]. As depicted in Figure 5, our compression method consistently outperforms
both NTC and ASTC across all bit ranges. Specifically, we employed the two most aggressive
variants of ASTC, which compressed 12 × 12, 10 × 10, 8 × 8 and 6 × 6 tiles. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant BD-rate improvement of 40.8% compared to NTC (our reimplementation). Compared methods In our comparative evaluation, we assessed our compression method alongside NTC (as proposed by [41]). Following the same settings as outlined in [41], we utilized the ‘-exhaustive’ flag
to achieve the best quality. To summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we also report the
Bjøntegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) [7]. Notably,
our re-implementation closely aligns with the performance reported in [41], with
the minor discrepancy arising from our use of a subset of publicly available
texture sets. Additionally, we compared our method’s performance against ASTC3
.

Qualitative results Figure 3d shows the original and reconstructed texture set
of our method, called Convolutional Neural Texture Compression (CNTC),
compared to NTC [41]. The compression profiles correspond to the lowest BPPC cases
shown in Figure 5.
5.3 Analysis
Effect of interpolation in grid samples Figure 6 shows the 4th channel
of the grid pair (G0, G1) next to their corresponding absolute Fourier transforms.
In Figure 6d, the Fourier transform of G1 has a concentration around
the center (low frequency components). This design choice aims to capture more abstract features. Figure 6b, on the other hand, shows that G0 is well suited to capture higher frequency components and provide more detailed information.
Effect of the global transformer As shown in Figure 7a, to demonstrate the effect of the global transformer and the grid constructors, we removed them from the compression framework and trained grid pairs directly as model parameters using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), following the approach in [41]. However, since the grid pair is 8 times smaller (both horizontally and vertically) than the texture set T, the grid pair learned via SGD has difficulty capturing high frequency information. As shown in Figure 8a, the PSNR of the model without a global transformer is significantly lower than that of the model with one. Increasing the bitrate does not significantly improve the situation.

This design choice aims to capture more
abstract features. As depicted in Figure 8a, the PSNR of the
model without a global transformer is significantly lower than that of the model
with one. However, due to the grid-pair being 8 times smaller (both horizontally
and vertically) than the texture set T, the grid-pair learned via SGD struggles to capture high-frequency information. Increasing the bit-rate does not substantially improve the situation. Qualitative results Figure 3d shows original and reconstructed texture set of
our method, referred to as Convolutional Neural Texture Compression (CNTC),
versus NTC [41]. Effect of Global transformer As illustrated in Figure 7a in order to demonstrate the impact of the Global transformer and Grid constructors, we removed
them from the compression framework and directly trained grid-pairs as model
parameters using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), following the approach
in [41]. Conversely, Figure 6b showcases that G0 is adept at capturing
higher frequency components and providing more detailed information. The compression profiles corresponds to the lowest BPPC cases
shown in Figure 5. In Figure 6d, the Fourier transform of G1 exhibits a concentration around
the center (low-frequency components). 5.3 Analysis
Effect of interpolation in grid-samplers Figure 6 displays the 4th channel of
the grid-pair (G0, G1) alongside their corresponding absolute Fourier transforms.

Impact of Synthesizer Depth To investigate the impact of texture synthesizer depth, we conducted an ablation study. We systematically reduced the number of residual blocks from the original design (which had four blocks) to zero blocks. This resulted in a synthesizer containing only two MLP layers. Figure 8c illustrates the results of this study. Using only a single residual layer, BBPC decreased by 8%. However, there was a trade-off: PSNR performance dropped by 11%. Interestingly, when we removed the residual block entirely, performance decreased significantly. This highlights the critical importance of the residual block in our design. 5.4 Discussion and Future Work This evaluation has highlighted the effectiveness of our approach, which leverages multiple levels of redundancy in texture compression. This approach provides a significant advantage over competing methods. However, we acknowledge certain limitations that we intend to address in future work. First, our current implementation of texture synthesis uses a pair of single-resolution rasters. This
requires an interpolation step to access the mip-levels in between. This rudimentary method can lead to aliasing, as also noted in [41]. In the future, we plan to investigate
a data-driven interpolation method. This approach would approach interpolation adaptively while preserving overall consistency across different
mip-levels. Second, the success of our method is closely linked to the robustness
of our global transformation, which exploits the multidimensional redundancy of the spatial channel resolution. In future work, we aim to improve this by exploring more representative and high-performance architectures. These would better capture the multilevel redundancy inherent in texture, possibly by employing attention mechanisms as proposed in [45].

Conclusion
This paper presents an innovative and effective method to address the challenge of automating texture compression development in photorealistic
rendering. The goal is to efficiently store textures, enable random access and
rendering at different resolutions, using learning methods to support all types of
texture components. Our key insight lies in analyzing the redundancy inherent in the problem. In particular, we identify several levels of redundancy:
between different channels of a texture, across different resolutions of the same
texture, and within individual pixels within each channel. Based on these observations, we propose novel techniques for texture compression. Our method
starts with a global transformation step that extracts a set of hidden global features 4.1. These features are then converted into dual-bank features through a mesh construction process. This process involves a dual-bank projection and
an asymmetric quantization step that adaptively splits the global features into two groups of different frequencies based on the global texture information 4.2. Next, our grid sampler samples these features corresponding to each encoding input position 4.3. Finally, we use texture synthesis to reconstruct these features back into the pixel space 4.4. Our results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms all conventional texture compression methods. Moreover, it often outperforms competing neural compression methods [41].

Abstract
The lack of ground truth labels poses a major challenge in developing optical flow estimation models that are both generalizable and robust. While current methods rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit the rich information available in labeled video sequences.
We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. OCAI uses a forward distortion approach and leverages occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values ​​and fills in missing values ​​by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student style semi-supervised learning method based on the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the predicted optical flow of the teacher model, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The teacher’s weights are maintained using the student’s exponential moving average. Our evaluations show perceptually superior interpolation quality and improved optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as Sintel and KITTI. 1. Introduction Optical flow estimation and video frame interpolation (VFI) have a complementary relationship. Accurate optical flow contributes significantly to various downstream tasks such as video compression [26, 44], video denoising and blur removal [3, 46, 49], action recognition [5, 22], and VFI is one of these applications. Pixel-level correspondence through optical flow enables pixel-level motion estimation and inter-frame generation. While the use of flow-based methods in VFI [12, 20, 23, 27] is a common practice, the use of inter-frames to train optical flow models is relatively under-researched.

The
teacher’s weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the
teacher model’s predicted optical flow, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. Our evaluations demonstrate
perceptually superior interpolation quality and enhanced
optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as
Sintel and KITTI. Introduction
Optical flow estimation and Video Frame Interpolation
(VFI) share a complementary relationship. 1. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student
style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. Accurate optical
flow contributes significantly to various downstream tasks
such as video compression [26, 44], video denoising and
blur removal [3, 46, 49], action recognition [5, 22], and VFI
stands as one of these applications. While utilizing flow-based methods is a common practice in
VFI [12, 20, 23, 27], leveraging inter-frames to train optical
flow models is relatively less explored. Pixel-level correspondence by optical flow enables estimating pixel-level movement and generating intermediate frames (or inter-frames). Abstract
The scarcity of ground-truth labels poses one major
challenge in developing optical flow estimation models that
are both generalizable and robust. Utilizing a forward warping approach, OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. While current methods
rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit
the rich information available in labeled video sequences.

Here is the transcript content:

While the lack of ground truth data has long been a critical challenge in learning-based optical flow estimation [8, 11, 13, 34, 38, 41], little attention has been paid to leveraging video frame interpolation (VFI) to improve the training of optical flow networks. Modern VFI models predominantly use deep networks trained to interpolate the exact middle frame between two consecutive time steps within a video sequence, which limits their ability to generate frames at other intermediate time points, thus affecting their ability to reliably generate optical flows between existing and intermediate frames. In addition, these models lack generalizability to new domains without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. These limitations hinder the potential use of existing VFI models. To address the lack of data in optical flow training, data augmentation [18, 39], data generation [8, 10, 39], and
semi-supervised learning [10, 14, 17, 18] have been investigated. Most current data augmentation methods
prioritize modifying the existing frames, e.g. [18], as shown in Fig. 1 (top). In particular, RealFlow[10] stands out
by synthesizing a new second frame through forward warping.
Given a pair of frames and the model’s prediction, the original first and second frames form a new training pair that is
used to update the model weights. Model prediction, frame synthesis, and model updating are iterated in an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, as shown in Fig. 1 (middle). While it is possible to use forward warping to interpolate frames, RealFlow only focuses on making the model's prediction consistent with frame synthesis. Moreover, the EM steps significantly increase the training effort.

While it is possible to use forward warping to interpolate frames, RealFlow focuses only on making the model’s
prediction consistent with frame synthesis. Most of the current data augmentation methods
prioritize modifying the existing frames, e.g., [18], as illustrated in Fig. Given a pair of frames and the model’s prediction, the original first and second frames form a new training pair, used
to update model weights. 1 (top). Besides, these models lack generalizability across new domains without necessitating finetuning or retraining. Model prediction, frame synthesis, and model update are iterated in an ExpectationMaximization (EM) framework, as depicted in Fig. State-of-the-art
VFI models predominantly employ deep networks trained
to interpolate the exact middle frame between two consecutive time steps within a video sequence, which restricts
their capability to generate frames at other intermediate
time instances thus hampering their ability to produce optical flows between existing and intermediate frames reliably. Moreover, the
EM steps significantly increase the training workload. 1 (middle). Notably, RealFlow[10] stands out
by synthesizing a new second frame via forward warping. While the scarcity of ground-truth data has long been
a critical challenge in learning-based optical flow estimation [8, 11, 13, 34, 38, 41], there has been little attention into leveraging Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) to augment the training of optical flow networks. These
limitations hinder the potential use of existing VFI models, To address data scarcity in optical flow training: data
augmentation [18, 39], data generation [8, 10, 39], and
semi-supervised learning [10, 14, 17, 18] have been explored.

In this paper, we introduce OCAI, a novel approach to train optical flow networks in a semi-supervised framework using readily available unlabeled pairs. Our method leverages video frames and flow interpolation to achieve this goal. OCAI implements an occlusion-aware forward warping technique that facilitates interpolation of both intermediate frames and interflows, can effectively handle pixel value ambiguities during the warping process without requiring depth information, and can confidently estimate missing values ​​using forward-backward consistency. Our algorithm can perform interpolations at each intermediate step, providing a wide variety of data and motion ranges essential for training optical flow models. Our innovative teacher-student style semi-supervised learning scheme leverages these resulting intermediate frames to effectively train optical flow networks. In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose a novel approach, OCAI, that addresses the challenge of data sparsity in training optical flow models by leveraging useful, hidden information in existing videos. Specifically, we interpolate frames and flows to generate additional data and use them in a semi-supervised learning framework.
• To this end, we propose a new, effective video interpolation method that infers occlusion information to address ambiguous pixels and fill holes by leveraging optical flow consistency. Our algorithm flexibly generates high-quality intermediate frames and reliable intermediate flows along with corresponding confidence maps at each intermediate step.
• We develop a new semi-supervised teacher-student learning strategy that leverages VFI to train an optical flow network and incorporates exponential moving averaging (EMA) to improve training stability.
• We show that OCAI achieves higher quality in video interpolation than existing SOTA methods on standard datasets including Sintel and KITTI. By incorporating interpolated video information, our semi-supervised learning scheme significantly improves the performance of optical flow estimation, e.g., 0.5+ Fl-all reduction on KITTI test set compared to state-of-the-art SOTA.

In this paper, we introduce OCAI, a novel approach
for training optical flow networks within a semi-supervised
framework using readily available unlabeled pairs. Our algorithm can perform
interpolation at any intermediate time step, thus offering a
broad diversity of data and motion ranges essential for training optical flow models. By incorporating interpolated video information, our semi-supervised
learning scheme significantly improves the optical flow
estimation performance, e.g., 0.5+ Fl-all reduction on
KITTI test set when comparing to latest SOTA. • We demonstrate that OCAI achieves higher quality in
video interpolation than existing SOTA methods on standard datasets including Sintel and KITTI. In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We propose a novel approach, OCAI, that tackles the
data scarcity challenge in training optical flow models, by exploiting useful, hidden information in existing
videos. Our
method leverages video frames and flow interpolation to
achieve this goal. Our algorithm flexibly generates
high-quality intermediate frames and reliable intermediate flows along with corresponding confidence maps at
any intermediate time step. Specifically, we interpolating frames and flows
to generate supplementary data, and use them in a semisupervised learning framework. Our innovative teacher-student
style semi-supervised learning scheme utilizes these resulting inter-frames to train optical flow networks effectively. OCAI implements an occlusion-aware
forward warping technique, facilitating the interpolation of
both inter-frames and intermediate flows, and can effectively tackle pixel value ambiguities during the warping
process without needing any depth information and can
do confidence-aware estimation of missing values utilizing
forward-backward consistency. • To do this, we propose a new, effective video interpolation method that derives occlusion information to address ambiguous pixels and fill in holes by exploiting optical flow consistency. • We devise a new teacher-student semi-supervised learning strategy leveraging VFI to train an optical flow
network, incorporating exponential moving averaging
(EMA) to enhance training stability.

RealFlow [10] uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) to train an optical flow model in a semi-supervised setting. First, the model is trained under supervision on existing ground truth data. Then, new data is synthesized based on the predicted optical flows and the forward bias. After that, the network is trained with the new data. RealFlow repeats these steps several times in the training process, which is computationally expensive. Many semi-supervised learning algorithms [25, 40] for other tasks such as classification and object detection use Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to robustly and stably update the teacher network using a temporal ensemble of the student network. In this paper, we leverage video interpolation and several semi-supervised training techniques to improve model performance. 3. Proposed Approach OCAI improves the accuracy of optical flow models by generating diverse, high-quality intermediate images and flows and trains the network with new pairs in a semi-supervised learning framework. In Section 3.1, we introduce our occlusion- and consistency-aware forward warping algorithm
for video interpolation. Next, in Section 3.2, we propose
a semi-supervised learning strategy to leverage video interpolation to better train optical flow networks.

it trains the network with the new data. 3. It first trains the model using supervision from existing

OCAI improves the accuracy of optical flow models by generating diverse, high-quality intermediate frames and flows,
and trains the network with new pairs in a semi-supervised
learning framework. In Section 3.1, we present our occlusion and consistency aware forward warping algorithm
for video interpolation. RealFlow repeats
the these steps several times in the training process, which
is computationally expensive.

To perform forward warping correctly, we need to solve two problems: pixel value ambiguity and missing pixel values. Ambiguity arises because two pixels in the source image move to the same position in the target image. In this case, we need to know which pixel is closer to the camera and therefore should be selected. Missing values ​​arise because a pixel position in the target image may correspond to an object that is occluded in the source image (and the occluding object moves away in the target image), where there are no pixels representing that occluded object. This can also be caused by an object moving closer to the camera and there are not enough pixels in the source image to represent the object in the target image. We propose occlusion-aware weighting to solve pixel value ambiguity and select the pixel that corresponds to what is closer to the camera. We also introduce a hole-filling method based on forward-backward consistency of optical flow. Fig. 2 provides an overview of our proposed
forward warping approach.
Occlusion-Aware Weighting to Solving Ambiguity
We solve pixel value ambiguity through occlusion understanding. In particular, we assume that a pixel that is not
occluded but creates occlusion for other pixels corresponds to an object that is closer to the camera.
More specifically, we derive an occlusion-aware weighting mask to be used in warping. First, we obtain the occlusion map O0,1 via forward-backward consistency [29],
which gives the occlusion region on I0; see how forward-backward consistency is calculated in Equation 1 of [29]. Next,
we apply backwarding to O0,1 using V0?1 and
further applying the non-occlusion mask 1 ?. O0,1 we can derive the
pixels in I0 that create an occlusion, i.e. foreground pixels,
and accordingly generate the mask to select these pixels.

In order to right perform forward warping , we need to resolve two go_forth : pel value ambiguity and missing pel values . Ambiguity is due to two pixels in the source frame moving to the same location in the target frame , in which case we need to understand which is closer to the camera and thus , should be chosen . Missing values is because a pel location in the target frame can correspond to an object that is occluded in the source frame ( and the occluding object moves away in target frame ) , where there are no pixels representing this occluded object . This can also be caused by an object moving closer to the camera and there are not enough pixels in the source frame to represent the object in the target frame . We propose occlusion-aware weighting to resolve pel value ambiguity and choose the pel that corresponds to what is closer to the camera . We further introduce a holefilling method based on the forward-backward consistency of optical flow . Fig . 2 provides an overview of our proposed forward warping approach . Occlusion-Aware Weighting to Resolve Ambiguity We resolve pel value ambiguity via occlusion understanding . Specifically , we assume that when a pel is not occluded but creates occlusion for other pixels , it corresponds to an object closer to the camera . More specifically , we derive an occlusion-aware weighting mask to be used in warping .

In order to correctly perform forward warping , we need to resolve two issues : pixel value ambiguity and mother missing pixel values . Ambiguity is due to two pixels in the source frame moving to the same location in the target frame , in which case we need to understand which is closer to the camera and thus , should be chosen . Missing values is because a pixel location in the target frame can correspond to an object that is occluded in the source frame ( and the occluding objective object moves away in target frame ) , where there are no pixels representing this occluded object . This can also be caused by an object moving closer to the camera and there are not enough pixels in the source frame to represent the object in the target frame . We propose occlusion-aware weighting to resolve pixel value ambiguity and choose the pixel that corresponds to what is closer to the camera . We further introduce a holefilling method based on the forward-backward consistency of optical flow . Fig . 2 provides an overview of our proposed forward warping approach . Occlusion-Aware Weighting to Resolve Ambiguity We resolve pixel value ambiguity via occlusion understanding . Specifically , we assume that when a pixel is not occluded but creates occlusion for other pixels , it corresponds to an object closer to the camera . More specifically , we derive an occlusion-aware weighting mask to be used in warping . First , we obtain occlusion map O0,1 via forward-backward consistency [ 29 ] , which indicates occlusion region on I0 ; see how to compute forward-backward consistency in Eq . 1 of [ 29 ] . Next , we apply backward warping to O0,1 using V0 ? 1 and by further applying the non-occlusion mask 1 ? O0,1 , we can infer the pixels in I0 that produce picture_element occlusion , i.e. , foreground pixels , and accordingly generate the mask to select these pixels .

2 provides an overview of our proposed
forward warping approach. 1 of [29]. Fig. We further introduce a holefilling method based on the forward-backward consistency
of optical flow. Next, we
apply backward warping to O0,1 using V0?1 and by further
applying the non-occlusion mask 1 ? We propose occlusion-aware weighting to resolve pixel
value ambiguity and choose the pixel that corresponds to
what is closer to the camera. First, we obtain occlusion map O0,1 via forward-backward consistency [29],
which indicates occlusion region on I0; see how to compute
forward-backward consistency in Eq. More specifically, we derive an occlusion-aware weighting mask to be used in warping. This can also be
caused by an object moving closer to the camera and there
are not enough pixels in the source frame to represent the
object in the target frame. Specifically, we assume that when a pixel is not
occluded but creates occlusion for other pixels, it corresponds to an object closer to the camera. O0,1, we can infer the
pixels in I0 that produce occlusion, i.e., foreground pixels,
and accordingly generate the mask to select these pixels. Missing values is because a pixel location in the target frame can correspond to
an object that is occluded in the source frame (and the occluding object moves away in target frame), where there are
no pixels representing this occluded object. In order to correctly perform forward warping, we need

We resolve pixel value ambiguity via occlusion understanding. Ambiguity is due to two pixels in the source

Experimental Setup
Video Frame Interpolation (VFI): We compare with the latest SOTA VFI algorithms [12, 20, 23, 27, 47]. We use their
official codes and weights trained on Vimeo90k [45]. In addition, we compare with RIPR from RealFlow [10] as our forward warping baseline. We use their official code to generate intermediate frames and RAFT [41] trained on FlyingChair
(C) [8] and FlyingThings3D (T) [28] as the optical flow model. In OCAI, we use the same optical flow network,
i.e., RAFT trained on C+T to enable a fair comparison. For evaluation, we use Sintel (S) [4] and KITTI (K) [9, 30], which are
standard optical flow datasets.2 More specifically, each test sample consists of three consecutive images, where the
first and third are used as existing images and the second as the
interpolation target. We use common image similarity metrics to evaluate VFI quality, including PSNR, SSIM [43], and LPIPS (using AlexNet and VGG) [50]. For more details, see the Supplementary File. Semi-supervised optical flow (SSOF): We use RAFT as the network architecture, following the previous training settings for semi-supervised optical flow models [10, 14, 18]. When evaluating on Sintel (Train) and SlowFlow [15], we first pre-train the network on C+T and then use FlyingThings3D (T) as the labeled dataset and Sintel (S) as the unlabeled dataset. For the evaluation of KITTI (Train), we use FlyingThings3D as the labeled dataset and KITTI (Multiview) as the unlabeled dataset, with initialization from the pre-trained weight of C+T. For the evaluations of Sintel and KITTI (Test), we use
the same labeled datasets (i.e., C+T+S+K+HD1K [19])
according to the original RAFT supervised training setting
and use Sintel training ((It, It+2) pairs), Monkaa [28] and
KITTI training dataset (Multiview) as the unlabeled data. Note
that Sintel and KITTI test sets are not used as unlabeled data
for training in these test evaluations.

Experimental Setup Video Frame Interpolation ( VFI ) : We compare with latest SOTA VFI algorithms [ 12 , 20 , 23 , 27 , 47 ] . We use their official codes and weights trained on Vimeo90k [ 45 ] . In addition , we compare with RIPR of RealFlow [ 10 ] as our forward warping service_line . We use their official code to generate inter-frames and RAFT [ 41 ] trained on FlyingChair ( C ) [ 8 ] and FlyingThings3D ( T ) [ twenty-eight ] as the optical flow model . In OCAI , we use the same optical flow network , i.e. , RAFT trained on C+T , for fair comparison . For rating , we use Sintel ( S ) [ 4 ] and KITTI ( K ) [ 9 , 30 ] , which are standard optical flow datasets.2 More specifically , each test sample consists of three consecutive frames , with the first and third used as existing frames , and the second as the interpolation target . We use commons image similarity metrics to evaluate VFI quality , including PSNR , SSIM [ 43 ] , and LPIPS ( using AlexNet and VGG ) [ 50 ] . More details can be found in the supplementary file . Semi-Supervised Optical Flow ( SSOF ) : We use RAFT as the network architecture , following previous semisupervised optical flow model training settings [ 10 , 14 , 18 ] . When evaluating on Sintel ( train ) and SlowFlow [ 15 ] , we first pretrain the network on C+T and and_then , use FlyingThings3D ( T ) as the labeled dataset and Sintel ( S ) as unlabeled dataset . For KITTI ( train ) rating , we use FlyingThings3D as the labeled dataset and KITTI ( multiview ) test as the unlabeled dataset , with initialization from C+T pretrained weight . For Sintel and KITTI ( test ) evaluations , we use the same labeled datasets ( i.e. , C+T+S+K+HD1K [ 19 ] ) following the original RAFT supervised training setting , and use Sintel training ( ( It , It+2 ) pairs ) , Monkaa [ twenty-eight ] , and KITTI ( multiview ) training dataset as unlabeled data . Note that Sintel and KITTI test sets are not used as unlabeled data for training in these test evaluations

We use their official code to generate inter-frames and RAFT [41] trained on FlyingChair
(C) [8] and FlyingThings3D (T) [28] as the optical flow
model. More details
can be found in the supplementary file. In addition, we compare with RIPR of RealFlow [10] as our forward warping baseline. For KITTI (train) evaluation, we use FlyingThings3D as the labeled dataset and KITTI (multiview) test
as the unlabeled dataset, with initialization from C+T pretrained weight. For evaluation, we use Sintel (S) [4] and KITTI (K) [9, 30], which
are standard optical flow datasets.2 More specifically, each
test sample consists of three consecutive frames, with the
first and third used as existing frames, and the second as the
interpolation target. We use common image similarity metrics to evaluate VFI quality, including PSNR, SSIM [43],
and LPIPS (using AlexNet and VGG) [50]. In OCAI, we use the same optical flow network,
i.e., RAFT trained on C+T, for fair comparison. Semi-Supervised Optical Flow (SSOF): We use RAFT
as the network architecture, following previous semisupervised optical flow model training settings [10, 14, 18]. Experimental Setup
Video Frame Interpolation (VFI): We compare with latest SOTA VFI algorithms [12, 20, 23, 27, 47]. Note
that Sintel and KITTI test sets are not used as unlabeled data
for training in these test evaluations For Sintel and KITTI (test) evaluations, we
use the same labeled datasets (i.e., C+T+S+K+HD1K [19])
following the original RAFT supervised training setting,
and use Sintel training ((It, It+2) pairs), Monkaa [28], and
KITTI (multiview) training dataset as unlabeled data. When evaluating on Sintel (train) and SlowFlow [15], we
first pretrain the network on C+T and then, use FlyingThings3D (T) as the labeled dataset and Sintel (S) as unlabeled
dataset. We use their
official codes and weights trained on Vimeo90k [45].

Video frame interpolation
Table 1 and Fig. 5 show the performance of the SOTA VFI methods, RealFlow's RIPR and our method on Sintel
(clean) and KITTI. We achieve the best LPIPS and
PSNR/SSIM values, which are comparable to existing SOTA solutions.
Note that PSNR and SSIM do not always correctly reflect the visual quality [33]. Since SOTA methods use backward warping and predict two intermediate optical flows (Vt?0
and Vt?1) without the inter-frame it, they do not perform well
when there are large displacements, resulting in blurring (see cars in Fig. 5). In contrast, forward warping methods (RealFlow's RIPR and ours) can accurately predict V0?1 and V1?0 and handle fast-moving objects better. Furthermore, our OCAI method produces better VFI quality than
RealFlow, with sharper image details and fewer holes. More
interpolation results with different t-values ​​(e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) can be found in the supplementary material.
OCAI only requires the optical flow model of RAFT with
5.3M parameters and shows better VFI performance compared to
existing SOTA methods with similar or more network parameters. Backward warping-based approaches
require additional training on Vimeo data with a pre-trained optical flow model, while RealFlow’s RIPR and our OCAI
only require the pre-trained optical flow model without additional training. Furthermore, we achieve better VFI values
than RIPR on both Sintel and KITTI. These results demonstrate that OCAI produces accurate inter-frames without
requiring depth estimation in forward warping.

We achieve the best LPIPS scores and
PSNR/SSIM scores on-par with existing SOTA solutions;
note that PSNR and SSIM do not always correctly reflect
visual quality [33]. Since SOTA methods use backward
warping and predict intermediate two optical flows (Vt?0
and Vt?1) without the inter-frame It, they do not work well
when there are large displacements, which results in blurriness (see cars in Fig 5). Video Frame Interpolation
Table 1 and Fig. 5 show the performance of SOTA VFI
methods, RIPR of RealFlow, and our method on Sintel
(clean) and KITTI. These results demonstrate that OCAI generates accurate inter-frames without
needing depth estimation in forward warping. More
interpolation results using different t values (e.g., 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8) can be found in the supplementary material. Furthermore, our OCAI method produces better VFI quality than
RealFlow, with sharper image details and fewer holes. OCAI only requires the RAFT optical flow model with
5.3M parameters and shows better VFI performance as
compared to existing SOTA methods using similar or more
network parameters. Backward-warping-based approaches
require additional training on Vimeo data with a pre-trained
optical flow model, while RIPR of RealFlow and our OCAI
only needs the pre-trained optical flow model without any
additional training. Moreover, we achieve better VFI scores
than RIPR on both Sintel and KITTI. In contrast, forward warping methods (RIPR of RealFlow and ours) can predict accurate V0?1 and V1?0, and handles fast moving objects better.

Optical Flow
Table 2 shows the results of evaluating optical flow estimation
on SlowFlow, Sintel and KITTI. We see that our proposed
OCAI achieves the best performance on all datasets. In particular, it has significantly more accurate optical flow estimation compared to the latest SOTA such as RealFlow and DistractFlow. In particular, on KITTI, OCAI brings almost 1-point reduction in Fl-epe compared to DistractFlow
and 1-point smaller Fl-all than RealFlow.
Table 3 shows the evaluation result on KITTI test dataset.
We achieve SOTA performance in semi-supervised optical flow on KITTI, which is a significant improvement compared to existing SOTA semi-supervised optical flow algorithms.
5. Ablation Studies
5.1. Video Frame Interpolation
Depth Weighting vs. Occlusion Aware Weighting Table 4
shows the effectiveness of our occlusion- and consistency-aware forward warping for VFI. The first row shows forward image warping with depth weighting. In the second row, we replace depth weighting with our occlusion-aware weighting mask, which shows comparable performance without using depth. Fig. 6 shows examples of qualitative results. Both RIPR (from RealFlow) with depth and occlusion-aware weighting have holes (see RIPR
(D) and RIPR (M)). Since RIPR performs hole filling with
a different warped image, a hole cannot be filled if both
images have holes in the same corresponding areas (e.g.,
wings and head in Fig. 6).
Image warping vs. flow warping. In the third row of
Table 4, we show the effect of applying forward warping
to the flow instead of the image (see optical flows in the third row
of Fig. 7). After performing hole filling based on optical flow consistency, our intermediate flows are significantly improved (see colored flows in the fourth row of Fig. 7). By generating the confidence maps, we can then combine two distorted images to generate the intermediate image more accurately (see OCAI output in Fig. 6).

In the second row , we replace depth are with our occlusionaware weighting mask , which shows comparable performance without using depth . Fig . 6 provides sample qualitative results . RIPR ( from RealFlow ) using depth and us ing occlusion-aware weighting both have holes ( See RIPR ( D ) and RIPR ( M ) ) . Since RIPR performs hole-filling using another warped image , a hole can not be filled when both images have holes in 7 same reduction regions ( e.g. , wings and head in Fig . 6 ) . Image warping vs. flow warping . In the third row of Table 4 , we show the effect of applying forward warping to flow instead of image ( see optical flows in the third row of Fig . the ) . After performing hole-filling based on optical flow consistency , our intermediate flows weighting significantly improved ( see inpainted flows in the fourth row of Fig . 7 ) . By generating the confidence maps , we can then combine two warped images to more accurately generate the interframe ( see OCAI output in Fig . 6 ) .

Semi-supervised optical flow
Using baseline VFI for semi-supervised learning. Table 5
shows an ablation study of the semi-supervised training.
RealFlow trains the model using the EM algorithm, which requires significantly more iterations. In our training, our model already has a lower Fl-epe and Fl-all score when using
only EMA than RealFlow with 1 EM iteration. By additionally masking the loss with a confidence map and imposing image distractions, the model improves further. Note that EMA is critical for training stability; training does not converge when teacher and student models are directly weighted. Finally, when using intermediate frames and flows generated by OCAI in training, our model achieves significantly lower Fl-epe and Fl-all.
VFI using an optical flow model trained using a semi-supervised scheme. After training the optical flow in a semi-supervised manner, we evaluate the VFI performance of the semi-supervised training in Table 6. Our semi-supervised training weight shows the improvements on all evaluation metrics on all datasets except Sintel PSNR in the 6 FPS to 12 FPS setting. While our OCAI trains the optical flow in a semi-supervised manner, improved optical flow can produce more accurate inter-frames. Our OCAI can not only increase the performance of the optical flow but also the VFI.

In our training, when
only using EMA, our model already has a lower Fl-all score
as compared to RealFlow with 1 EM iteration. VFI using optical flow model trained from semisupervised scheme. Semi-Supervised Optical Flow
Using baseline VFI for semi-supervised learning. Note
that EMA is crucial for training stability; the training fails
to converge when teacher and student models are directly
weight-shared. While our OCAI trains the optical flow in
a semi-supervised manner, improved optical flow can generate more accurate inter-frame. Table 5
shows an ablation study of the semi-supervised training. Finally, when using intermediate frames and
flows generated by OCAI in training, our model achieves
significantly lower Fl-epe and Fl-all. RealFlow trains the model using EM algorithm, which requires significantly more iterations. By additionally masking the loss with confidence map and imposing image distractions, the model further improves. After we train the optical flow in semisupervised manner, we evaluate the VFI performance of
semi-supervised training in Table 6. Our semi-supervised
training weight shows the improvements on all evaluation
metrics on all dataset except for Sintel PSNR in 6 FPS to
12 FPS setting. Our OCAI can boost the
performances of not only optical flow but also VFI.

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel scheme that greatly extends the training of optical flow models. This effectively addresses the lack of optical flow labels in existing datasets. More specifically, we first proposed a video frame interpolation method that can detect occlusion and robustly generate intermediate frames as well as the intervening optical flows despite large motions. This enables us to greatly extend existing optical flow training data at no cost.
We also proposed a semi-supervised training approach that leverages video frame interpolation. Through extensive experiments on standard optical flow benchmarks such as Sintel and KITTI, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and that it represents the state-of-the-art.

Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages both 2D and 3D attention to enable highly accurate depth completion without the need for iterative spatial propagations. Specifically, we first improve a basic convolutional depth completion model by focusing attention on 2D features in the bottleneck and skip connections. This effectively improves the performance of this simple network and puts it on par with the latest, complex transformer-based models. Leveraging the initial depths and features of this network, we lift the 2D features to form a 3D point cloud and construct a 3D point transformer to process them, allowing the model to explicitly learn and utilize 3D geometric features. In addition, we propose normalization techniques to process the point cloud, which improve learning and lead to higher accuracy than directly using off-the-shelf point transformers. Furthermore, we integrate global attention on downsampled point cloud features, which enables long-range context while still being computationally feasible. We evaluate our method, DeCoTR, against established depth completion benchmarks, including NYU Depth V2 and KITTI, and show that it sets new top-of-the-line performance. Furthermore, we perform zero-shot evaluations on ScanNet and DDAD benchmarks and show that DeCoTR exhibits superior generalizability compared to existing approaches.

1Introduction
†
Depth is crucial for 3D perception in various downstream applications such as autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality, and robotics [2, 1, 9, 11, 8, 35, 51, 50, 33, 43, 34]. However, sensor-based depth measurement is far from perfect. Such measurements often exhibit sparsity, low resolution, noise interference, and incompleteness. Various factors, including environmental conditions, motion, sensor performance limitations, and the presence of specular, transparent, wet, or non-reflective surfaces, contribute to these limitations. Consequently, the task of depth completion, which aims to create dense and accurate depth maps from sparse measurements adjacent to aligned camera images, has emerged as a key area of ​​research.

Depth is crucial for 3D perception in various downstream applications, such as autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality, and robotics [2, 1, 9, 11, 8, 35, 51, 50, 33, 43, 34]. Consequently, the task of depth completion, aimed at generating dense and accurate depth maps from sparse measurements alongside aligned camera images, has emerged as a pivotal research area Furthermore, we incorporate global attention on downsampled point cloud features, which enables long-range context while still being computationally feasible. Various factors, including environmental conditions, motion, sensor power constraints, and the presence of specular, transparent, wet, or non-reflective surfaces, contribute to these limitations. Specifically, we first enhance a baseline convolutional depth completion model by applying attention to 2D features in the bottleneck and skip connections. Leveraging the initial depths and features from this network, we uplift the 2D features to form a 3D point cloud and construct a 3D point transformer to process it, allowing the model to explicitly learn and exploit 3D geometric features. However, sensor-based depth measurement is far from perfect. This effectively improves the performance of this simple network and sets it on par with the latest, complex transformer-based models. In addition, we propose normalization techniques to process the point cloud, which improves learning and leads to better accuracy than directly using point transformers off the shelf. Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses both 2D and 3D attentions to enable highly accurate depth completion without requiring iterative spatial propagations. Such measurements often exhibit sparsity, low resolution, noise interference, and incompleteness. We evaluate our method, DeCoTR, on established depth completion benchmarks, including NYU Depth V2 and KITTI, showcasing that it sets new state-of-the-art performance.

Thanks to advances in deep learning, significant progress has been made in depth completion. Previous works leverage convolutional neural networks to perform image-guided depth completion and achieve promising results [27, 3, 37]. To improve accuracy, researchers have investigated various spatial propagation methods [25, 4, 29, 24] that perform further iterative processing based on depth maps and features computed by an initial network. Most existing solutions build on this in the final stage of their depth completion pipeline to improve performance [17, 45]. However, these propagation algorithms focus on 2D feature processing and do not fully exploit the 3D nature of the problem. Some recent works use transformers for depth completion [45, 32]. However, they mainly apply transformer operations to improve feature learning at the 2D image level and do not achieve acceptable accuracy without the use of spatial propagation.

Several studies have addressed the more extensive use of the 3D representation. For example, in [18, 49], a point cloud is constructed from the sparse input depth, but dealing with extreme sparsity poses a challenge for effective feature learning. Another approach, as seen in [26], lifts 2D features to 3D by using the initial dense depth predicted by a simple convolutional network, but this is hampered by the poor accuracy of the initial network and requires dynamic propagations to achieve acceptable accuracy. More recently, researchers have proposed using transformers for 3D feature learning in depth completion [44]. However, this work applies transformer layers to extremely sparse points, which is ineffective for learning informative 3D features.

However, they apply transformer operations mainly to improve feature learning on the 2D image plane and fail to achieve acceptable accuracy without employing spatial propagation. Most existing solutions build on this in the last stage of their depth completion pipeline to improve performance [17, 45]. Earlier papers leverage convolutional neural networks to perform depth completion with image guidance and achieve promising results [27, 3, 37]. Another approach, as seen in [26], uplifts 2D features to 3D by using the initial dense depth predicted by a simple convolutional network, but it is impeded by the poor accuracy of the initial network and requires dynamic propagations to attain acceptable accuracy. These propagation algorithms, however, focus on 2D feature processing and do not fully exploit the 3D nature of the problem. In order to improve accuracy, researchers have studied various spatial propagation methods [25, 4, 29, 24], which performs further iterative processing on top of depth maps and features computed by an initial network. Thanks to the advances in deep learning, there has been significant progress in depth completion. For instance, [18, 49] construct a point cloud from the input sparse depth, yet coping with extreme sparsity poses challenges in effective feature learning. A few recent papers utilize transformers for depth completion [45, 32]. Several studies have looked into harnessing 3D representation more comprehensively. Very recently, researchers have proposed employing transformers for 3D feature learning in depth completion [44]; however, this work applies transformer layers to extremely sparse points, which is ineffective for learning informative 3D features.

Here we introduce DeCoTR to perform feature learning in full 3D. This is achieved by creating a dense feature point cloud derived from full depth values ​​obtained from an initial network and then applying Transformer processing to these 3D points. To do this properly, it is important to have reasonably accurate initial depths. Therefore, we first improve a commonly used convolution-based initial depth network, S2D [27], by incorporating Transformer layers on bottleneck and skip-connection features. This improved model, called S2D-TR, achieves significantly improved depth accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models without the need for iterative spatial propagation.

Starting from the initial depth map, we elevate 2D features to 3D to form a point cloud, which is subsequently processed by Transformer layers, which we refer to as 3D-TR layers. Before feeding the points to the transformer layers, we normalize them, which regularizes the 3D feature learning and leads to better accuracy. In each 3D TR layer, we follow standard practice [46, 40] to perform neighborhood-based attention, since global attention would be computationally intractable with a large number of points. To enable contextual understanding over long distances, we additionally integrate global attention on smaller-scale versions of the point cloud. Finally, 3D features are projected back to the 2D image plane and used by a decoder to produce the final depth prediction. As we will see in this paper, our proposed transformer-based learning in full 3D provides significantly improved accuracy and generalizability for depth completion; a visual example is provided in Fig. 1.

It accomplishes this by constructing a dense feature point cloud derived completed depth values obtained from an initial network and subsequently applying transformer processing to these 3D points . To do this properly , it is essential to have reasonably accurate initial depths . As such , we first enhance a commonly used convolution-based initial depth network , S2D [ 27 ] , by integrating transformer layers on skip connection . This upgraded model , termed S2D-TR , achieves significantly improved depth accuracy , on par with state-of-the-art models , without requiring any iterative spatial propagation . Given the initial depth map , we uplift 2D features to 3D to form a point cloud , which is subsequently processed by transformer layers , which we refer as 3D-TR layers . to feeding the points to transformer layers , we normalize them , which regularizes the 3D feature learning and leads to better accuracy . each 3D-TR layer , we standard practice [ 46 , 40 ] to perform neighborhood-based attention , as global attention would be computationally intractable when the number of points is . To facilitate long-range contextual understanding , we additionally global attention on versions of the point cloud . Finally , 3D features are projected back to the 2D image plane and consumed by a decoder to produce the final depth prediction . As we shall see in the paper , our proposed transformer-based learning in full provides considerably improved accuracy and generalizability depth completion ; see Fig . 1 for a visual example .

Prior to feeding the points to transformer layers, we normalize them, which regularizes the 3D feature learning and leads to better accuracy. As such, we first enhance a commonly used convolution-based initial depth network, S2D [27], by integrating transformer layers on bottleneck and skip connection features. This upgraded model, termed S2D-TR, achieves significantly improved depth accuracy, on par with state-of-the-art models, without requiring any iterative spatial propagation. Finally, 3D features are projected back to the 2D image plane and consumed by a decoder to produce the final depth prediction. Given the initial depth map, we uplift 2D features to 3D to form a point cloud, which is subsequently processed by transformer layers, to which we refer as 3D-TR layers. As we shall see in the paper, our proposed transformer-based learning in full 3D provides considerably improved accuracy and generalizability for depth completion; see Fig. Here, we introduce DeCoTR to perform feature learning in full 3D. 1 for a visual example. To facilitate long-range contextual understanding, we additionally incorporate global attention on lower-scale versions of the point cloud. In each 3D-TR layer, we follow standard practice [46, 40] to perform neighborhood-based attention, as global attention would be computationally intractable when the number of points is large. To do this properly, it is essential to have reasonably accurate initial depths. It accomplishes this by constructing a dense feature point cloud derived from completed depth values obtained from an initial network and subsequently applying transformer processing to these 3D points.

In summary, our main contributions are as follows:

• We present DeCoTR, a novel transformer-based approach to perform full 3D feature learning for depth completion. This enables high-quality depth estimation without iterative processing steps.

• To do this properly, we update the commonly used initial network S2D by improving its bottleneck and skip-connection features using transformers. The resulting model, S2D-TR, is on par with SOTA and provides more correct depths for subsequent 3D learning.

• We develop useful techniques to normalize the lifted 3D feature point cloud, which improves model learning. We additionally apply low-resolution global attention to 3D points, which improves long-range understanding without making computation impossible.

• Through extensive evaluations on the standard benchmarks NYU Depth v2 [36] and KITTI [14], we demonstrate the effectiveness of DeCoTR and show that it sets the new SOTA, i.e., the new best result on NYU Depth v2. Our zero-shot tests on ScanNet [7] and DDAD [15] further demonstrate the better generalizability of our model compared to existing methods.

Depth completion: Early approaches to depth completion [38, 16, 22] rely solely on the sparse depth measurements to estimate the dense depth. Since these methods do not utilize the image, they usually suffer from artifacts such as blurring, especially at object boundaries. Later image-guided depth completions alleviate these problems by incorporating the image. S2D [27], one of the first works on this topic, uses a convolutional network to utilize both the image and the sparse depth map. Subsequent works design more sophisticated convolutional models for depth completion [31, 3, 19, 48, 37]. To improve depth quality, researchers have investigated various spatial propagation algorithms [4, 5, 29, 24]. These solutions leverage depth values ​​and features provided by an initial network (usually S2D) and perform iterative steps to mix and aggregate features on the 2D image plane. It has now become common practice in many works to use spatial propagation in addition to the proposed depth completion network to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy [17, 28, 45]. Some recent works integrate iterative processing more into the network and use architectures such as recurrent networks [39] and repetitive hourglass networks [42].

While existing solutions predominantly propose architectures to process features in 2D, several works explore 3D representations. For example, [18, 49, 44] considers sparse depth as a point cloud and learns features from it. However, the extremely sparse points pose a challenge for feature learning. One of these works, GraphCSPN [26], uses S2D as the initial network to generate the full depth map before constructing a denser point cloud and performing feature learning on it. However, this is limited by the insufficient accuracy of the initial depths by S2D and still requires iterative processing to achieve good accuracy.

Vision Transformers: Since their introduction [10], vision transformers have been widely studied and applied to various computer vision tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, tracking, 3D reconstruction, and more. We refer readers to these reviews for more comprehensive coverage of these works. Closer to our paper are those that leverage vision transformers for depth completion, such as CompletionFormer [45] and GuideFormer [32]. While they demonstrate the effectiveness of using vision transformers for depth completion, their feature learning is only performed on the 2D image plane. A very recent paper, PointDC [44], proposes applying transformers to 3D point clouds in the depth completion pipeline. However, PointDC operates on very sparse points, which makes 3D feature learning difficult.

3Method
In this section, we introduce our proposed approach DeCoTR, which is powered by efficient 2D and powerful 3D attention learning. The entire pipeline of DeCoTR is shown in Fig. 2.

3.1Problem Statement
Given an aligned sparse depth map 
S
?

, the goal of image-guided depth completion is to recover a dense depth map 
D

based on

and with semantic guidance from

where

Experiments
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed DeCoTR against standard depth completion benchmarks and compare it with the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. In addition, we perform a zero-shot evaluation to assess the generalizability of the model and conduct ablation studies to analyze different parts of our proposed approach.

Datasets: We perform standard depth completion evaluations on NYU Depth v2 (NYUD-v2) [36] and KITTI Depth Completion (KITTI-DC) [13, 14], as well as generalization tests on ScanNet-v2 [7] and DDAD [15]. These datasets cover a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. We follow the sampling settings from existing works to create a sparse input depth [29, 26].

NYUD-v2 provides RGB images and depth maps captured by a Kinect device from 464 different indoor scenes. We use the official split: 249 scenes for training and the remaining 215 for testing. Following common practice [29, 26, 45], we sample 50,000 images from the training set and resize the images from 480 × 640 first to half and then to 228 × 304 with centered cropping. For evaluation, we use the official test set with 654 images. KITTI is a large real-world dataset in the field of autonomous driving with over 90,000 paired RGB images and LiDAR depth measurements. There are two versions of the KITTI dataset used for depth completion. One is from [27] and consists of 46,000 images from the training sequences for training and a random subset of 3,200 images from the test sequences for evaluation. The other is the KITTI Depth Completion (KITTI-DC) dataset, which contains 86,000 training, 6,900 validation, and 1,000 test samples with corresponding raw LiDAR scans and reference images. We use KITTI-DC to train and test our model using the official splits.

ScanNet-v2 contains 1,513 spatial scans reconstructed from RGB-D frames. The dataset is split into 1,201 scenes for training and 312 for validation, and provides an additional 100 scenes for testing. For sparse input depths, we extract point clouds from the vertices of the reconstructed meshes. We use the 100 test scenes to evaluate the depth completion performance, randomly selecting 20 frames per scene. We remove samples that are missing more than 10% of the actual depth values, resulting in 745 test frames across all 100 test scenes.

DDAD is an autonomous driving dataset collected in the US and Japan using a synchronized 6-camera array, covering long distances (up to 250 m) and various urban driving scenarios. Following [15], we reduce the images from the original resolution of 
1216
×
1936
to 
384
×
640
. For evaluation, we use the official 3,950 validation samples. Since only less than 
5
%
valid ground truth depth remains after reduction, for our method and all comparisons we collect all available valid depth points to obtain reasonable results.

We use the official test set of 654 images for evaluation. We further perform zero-shot evaluation to assess the model generalizability and carry out ablation studies to analyze different parts of our proposed approach. The dataset is divided into 1,201 scenes for training and 312 for validation, and provides an additional 100 scenes for testing. Experiments
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed DeCoTR on standard depth completion benchmarks and compare with the latest state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions. We follow the sampling settings from existing works to create input sparse depth [29, 26]. One is from [27], which consists of 46,000 images from the training sequences for training and a random subset of 3,200 images from the test sequences for evaluation. 4.1Experimental Setup
Datasets: We perform standard depth completion evaluations on NYU Depth v2 (NYUD-v2) [36] and KITTI Depth Completion (KITTI-DC) [13, 14], and generalization tests on ScanNet-v2 [7] and DDAD [15]. There are two versions of KITTI dataset used for depth completion. ScanNet-v2 contains 1,513 room scans reconstructed from RGB-D frames. Since after downsampling there’s only less than

We remove samples where more than 10% of the ground-truth depth values are missing, resulting in 745 test frames across all 100 test scenes. DDAD is an autonomous driving dataset collected in the U.S. and Japan using a synchronized 6-camera array, featuring long-range (up to 250m) and diverse urban driving scenarios.

and no weight decay. The batch size for NYUDv2 and KITTI-DC per GPU is set to 8 and 4, respectively. All experiments are conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

. In the KITTI-DC test, we use the official metrics: RMSE, MAE, iRMSE and iMAE. For detailed mathematical definitions of these metrics, please refer to the supplementary file. The depth values ​​are evaluated with maximum distances of 80 meters and 200 meters for KITTI and DDAD, respectively, and 10 meters for NYUD-v2 and ScanNet.

4.2 Results on NYUD-v2 and KITTI
See caption
Figure 3: Qualitative results on NYUD-v2. We compare with SOTA methods such as NLSPN, GraphCSPN and CompletionFormer. Areas where DeCoTR provides better depth accuracy are highlighted.
On NYUD-v2: Table 1 summarizes the quantitative evaluation results on NYUD-v2. Our proposed DeCoTR approach sets the new SOTA performance, with the lowest RMSE of 0.086 outperforming all existing solutions. When 3D global attention is not used, DeCoTR already provides the best accuracy and global attention improves it even further. In particular, our DeCoTR significantly outperforms the latest SOTA methods that also leverage 3D representations and/or transformers, such as GraphCSPN, PointDC, and CompletionFormer. Note that although PointDC uses both 3D representations and transformers, it achieves only a slightly lower RMSE compared to methods that use neither 3D nor transformers (e.g., CompletionFormer, GraphCSPN). This suggests that the PointDC approach is suboptimal, possibly due to the extremely sparse 3D points.

Fig. 3 shows example qualitative results for NYUD-v2. We see that DeCoTR generates highly accurate dense depth maps that are very close to the ground truth. The depth maps produced by DeCoTR capture much finer details compared to existing SOTA methods. For example, in the second example, our proposed approach accurately predicts the depth of the faucet despite its small size in the images and low contrast, while other methods struggle with it.

Regarding KITTI-DC: We evaluate DeCoTR and compare it with existing methods (including the latest SOTA) on the official KITTI test set, as shown in Table 2. DeCoTR achieves SOTA depth completion accuracy and is among the top-ranked methods on the KITTI-DC leaderboard.1 We see that DeCoTR performs significantly better than existing SOTA methods that leverage 3D representations, e.g., GraphCSPN, PointDC. This shows that DeCoTR provides the right combination of dense 3D representation and transformer-based learning.

Zero-shot testing on ScanNet and DDAD
Most existing works only evaluate their models on NYUD-v2 and KITTI without examining the generalizability of the model. In this part, we perform a cross-dataset evaluation. More specifically, we perform zero-shot testing of NYUD-v2 trained models on ScanNet-v2 and KITTI trained models on DDAD. This allows us to understand how well our DeCoTR as well as existing SOTA models generalize to data that was not seen in training.

Tables 3 and 4 show the evaluation results on ScanNet-v2 and DDAD, respectively. We see that DeCoTR generalizes better to unknown datasets compared to existing SOTA models. It is worth noting that DeCoTR on DDAD has significantly lower depth errors compared to NLSPN and CompletionFormer, although CompletionFormer has a slightly lower RMSE on the KITTI-DC test. Moreover, CompletionFormer has even worse accuracy than NLSPN in this case, indicating its poor generalizability.

Fig. 5 shows example visual results of zero-shot depth completion on ScanNet-v2. DeCoTR generates highly accurate depth maps and captures fine details, e.g. armrest in the first example, lamp in the second example. Other methods cannot recover the depths accurately. Fig. 6 provides qualitative results on DDAD for CompletionFormer and our DeCoTR. Although this is a challenging test setting given the much larger depth range in DDAD, DeCoTR still predicts reasonable depths. In contrast, it can be seen that CompletionFormer performs very poorly on DDAD. We find that DeCoTR's predictions are more accurate at closer range (e.g., cars) and less accurate at far distances (e.g., trees) because KITTI training only covers up to 80 meters, while DDAD has a depth of up to 200 meters. This is also confirmed by the lower than KITTI RMSE and higher than KITTI MAE numbers of DeCoTR on DDAD.

Zero-Shot Testing on ScanNet and DDAD Most existing papers only evaluate their models on NYUD-v2 and KITTI , without looking into model generalizability . In this part , we perform cross-dataset evaluation . More specifically , we run zero-shot testing of NYUD-v2-trained models on ScanNet-v2 and KITTI-trained models on DDAD . This will allow us to understand how well our DeCoTR as well as existing SOTA models generalize to data not seen in training . Tables 3 and 4 present evaluation results on ScanNet-v2 and DDAD , respectively . We see that DeCoTR generalizes dependable to unseen datasets when comparing to existing SOTA models . It it noteworthy to mention that on DDAD , DeCoTR has significantly lower depth errors as compared to both NLSPN and CompletionFormer , despite that CompletionFormer has slightly lower RMSE on KITTI-DC test . Moreover , in this case , CompletionFormer has even worse accuracy than NLSPN , indicating its poor generalizability . Fig . Phoebe shows sample visual results of zero-shot depth completion on ScanNet-v2 . DeCoTR generates highly accurate depth maps and captures fine details , e.g. , arm rest in the first example , lamp in the second example . Other methods can not recover the depths accurately . Fig . 6 provides qualitative results on DDAD for CompletionFormer and our DeCoTR . While this is a challenging test setting given the much larger depth range in DDAD , DeCoTR still predicts reasonable depths . In contrast , it can be seen that CompletionFormer performs very poorly on DDAD . We notice that DeCoTR ’ s predictions are more accurate in the dear range ( e.g. , on cars ) and less so when it is Army_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda away ( e.g. , on trees ) , since KITTI training only covers up to 80 meters whereas DDAD has depth up to cc meters . This is also confirmed by the lower-than-KITTI RMSE and higher-than-KITTI MAE numbers of DeCoTR on DDAD .

Fig. Fig. Tables 3 and 4 present evaluation results on ScanNet-v2 and DDAD, respectively. 6 provides qualitative results on DDAD for CompletionFormer and our DeCoTR. This is also confirmed by the lower-than-KITTI RMSE and higher-than-KITTI MAE numbers of DeCoTR on DDAD. This will allow us to understand how well our DeCoTR as well as existing SOTA models generalize to data not seen in training. While this is a challenging test setting given the much larger depth range in DDAD, DeCoTR still predicts reasonable depths. We notice that DeCoTR’s predictions are more accurate in the nearer range (e.g., on cars) and less so when it is far away (e.g., on trees), since KITTI training only covers up to 80 meters whereas DDAD has depth up to 200 meters. 5 shows sample visual results of zero-shot depth completion on ScanNet-v2. More specifically, we run zero-shot testing of NYUD-v2-trained models on ScanNet-v2 and KITTI-trained models on DDAD. DeCoTR generates highly accurate depth maps and captures fine details, e.g., arm rest in the first example, lamp in the second example. We see that DeCoTR generalizes better to unseen datasets when comparing to existing SOTA models. Other methods cannot recover the depths accurately. It it noteworthy to mention that on DDAD, DeCoTR has significantly lower depth errors as compared to both NLSPN and CompletionFormer, despite that CompletionFormer has slightly lower RMSE on KITTI-DC test.

Moreover, in this case, CompletionFormer has even worse accuracy than NLSPN, indicating its poor generalizability. In contrast, it can be seen that CompletionFormer performs very poorly on DDAD.

4.4 Ablation Study
In this part, we investigate the effectiveness of different design aspects of our proposed DeCoTR solution. Table 5 summarizes the results of the ablation study. Starting from the S2D baseline, we significantly improve the depth completion performance by introducing efficient attention to the 2D features and reducing the RMSE from 0.204 to 0.094. Next, we reduce the RMSE to 0.089 by applying neighborhood-based cross-attention to the 3D points (without normalizing the point cloud before the 3D TR layers). Although scaling a 3D scene to a uniform perceived area can be challenging to maintain the original spatial relationship, after applying our normalization scheme, DeCoTR achieves a better RMSE of 0.087 and by additionally incorporating efficient global attention, the RMSE is further improved to 0.086. This study confirms the usefulness of our proposed components and techniques.

See caption
Figure 6: Qualitative results of zero-shot inference on DDAD. Areas where DeCoTR provides better depth accuracy are highlighted.
Note that while we can drastically improve S2D by directly applying 3D-TR to the original S2D ​​network (second row in the table), we cannot outperform existing methods that leverage 3D or transformers such as GraphCSPN and CompletionFormer. This confirms the importance of obtaining a more accurate initial depth before applying 3D feature learning.

5Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a new approach, DeCoTR, for image-guided depth completion by leveraging transformer-based learning in full 3D. We first proposed an efficient attention scheme to improve the common baseline of S2D, so that S2D-TR can provide more accurate initial depth completion. 2D features are then lifted to form a 3D point cloud, followed by 3D TR layers that apply powerful neighborhood-based cross-attention to the 3D points. We also designed an efficient global attention operation to enable scene-level understanding while keeping computational costs under control. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that DeCoTR achieves SOTA performance on standard benchmarks such as NYUD-v2 and KITTI-DC. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on previously unseen datasets such as ScanNet and DDAD demonstrates that DeCoTR has better generalizability compared to existing methods.

We further devised an efficient global attention operation to provide scene-level understanding while keeping computation costs in check. 4.4Ablation Study
In this part, we investigate the effectiveness of various design aspects of our proposed DeCoTR solution. This confirms the importance of getting more accurate initial depth before applying 3D feature learning. Note that if we directly apply 3D-TR on top of the original S2D network (second row in the table), we can still drastically improve upon S2D but fail to outperform existing methods that leverage 3D or transformers such as GraphCSPN and CompletionFormer. Even though scaling a 3D scene to a uniform perceived range may present a challenge to maintain the original spatial relationship, after applying our normalization scheme, DeCoTR achieves a better RMSE of 0.087 and by additionally incorporating efficient global attention, the RMSE is further improved to 0.086. Through extensive experiments, we have shown that DeCoTR achieves SOTA performance on standard benchmarks like NYUD-v2 and KITTI-DC. Areas where DeCoTR provide better depth accuracy are highlighted. We first proposed an efficient attention scheme to upgrade the common baseline of S2D, allowing S2D-TR to provide more accurate initial depth completion.

Figure 6:Qualitative results of zero-shot inference on DDAD. 5Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, DeCoTR, for image-guided depth completion, by employing transformer-based learning in full 3D. Starting from the S2D baseline, we significantly improve depth completion performance by introducing efficient attention on the 2D features, reducing RMSE from 0.204 to 0.094. Next, by using neighborhood-based cross-attention on the 3D points (without normalizing the point cloud before 3D-TR layers), we reduce RMSE to 0.089. 2D features are then uplifted to form a 3D point cloud followed by 3D-TR layers that apply powerful neighborhood-based cross-attention on the 3D points.

Abstract
The rise of new video modalities such as virtual reality or autonomous driving has increased the demand for efficient multi-view video compression methods, both in terms of rate-distortion (R-D) performance and in terms of delay and runtime. While recent stereo video compression approaches have shown promising performance, they compress left and right views sequentially, resulting in poor parallelization and runtime performance. This work presents the Low-Latency Neural Codec for Stereo Video Streaming (LLSS), a novel parallel stereo video coding method designed for fast and efficient low-latency stereo video streaming. Instead of using sequential cross-view motion compensation like existing methods, LLSS introduces a bidirectional feature shifting module to directly exploit mutual information between views and effectively encode them with a common cross-view prior model for entropy coding. Thanks to this design, LLSS processes left and right views in parallel, minimizing latency; all while providing significantly improved R-D performance compared to existing neural and traditional codecs. 1. Introduction
The increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles (AVs) equipped with stereo cameras, as well as the widespread use of virtual reality (VR) headsets, has led to a significant increase in stereo video data. For AVs, stereo cameras serve as a cost-effective alternative to sensors such as LIDAR or RADAR. The data they capture is critical for time-critical safety analysis during vehicle operation and requires low-latency data transmission. In virtual reality, the resolution and latency requirements are even higher to achieve an immersive user experience. For both AV and VR applications, it is critical that the codec efficiently encodes stereo video while maintaining low latency.

In this work, we present a Low-Latency Stereo Video
1
arXiv:2403.17879v1 [cs.CV] March 26, 2024
Streaming (LLSS) codec designed for parallel stereo video coding. The development of this codec is based on two key insights. First, inspired by recent advances in stereo matching methods [9, 20, 50], the disparity compensation module between left and right views can be greatly simplified compared to complex motion compensation schemes in LSVC [10]. It can be efficiently represented using horizontal shifts. Second, we observed that these disparity compensations can be performed simultaneously for both views. A careful encoder design that shares horizontally shifted features across multiple views can implicitly estimate disparity while facilitating parallel processing of both views, achieving low-latency inference. Figure 1 shows a schematic comparison of these approaches. We introduce a
novel component, BiShiftMod (Bidirectional Shifting Module), that facilitates the connections and information exchange between views in our network. This module is integrated into both the codec and the hypercodec [5, 42], enabling
data-dependent optimization of mutual information between views. By following this approach, we
replace sequential disparity compensation with a parallel coding network that can exploit mutual information between views
in a “disparity-agnostic” manner.

In this work , we present a Low-Latency Stereo video 1 arXiv:2403.17879v1 [ cs.CV ] 26 Mar 2024 Streaming ( LLSS ) codec designed for parallel stereo video coding . This codec ’ s development is grounded in two key insights . First , inspired from the recent progresses in the stereo matching methods [ 9 , 20 , 50 ] , the disparity compensation module between left and right views can be greatly simplified , compared to complex motion compensation schemes in LSVC [ 10 ] . It can be efficiently represented with horizontal shifts . Second , we observed that these disparity compensations can be executed concurrently for both views . A careful encoder design , sharing horizontallyshifted features across views , can implicitly estimate disparity , while facilitating parallel processing of both views , thereby achieving low-latency inference . Figure 1 shows a schematic comparison of these approaches . We introduce a novel at_the_same_time component , BiShiftMod ( Bidirectional Shifting Module ) , which facilitates the connections be and information exchange between views in our network . This module is integrated into both the codec and hypercodec [ 5 , 42 ] , which enables data-dependent optimization of the cross-view mutual information . By following this approach , we replace the sequential disparity compensation with a parallel coding network that can exploit cross-view mutual information in a “ disparity-agnostic ” fashion .

In this work, we present a Low-Latency Stereo video
1
arXiv:2403.17879v1 [cs.CV] 26 Mar 2024
Streaming (LLSS) codec designed for parallel stereo video
coding. It can be efficiently represented
with horizontal shifts. A careful encoder design, sharing horizontallyshifted features across views, can implicitly estimate disparity, while facilitating parallel processing of both views,
thereby achieving low-latency inference. Figure 1 shows a
schematic comparison of these approaches. Second, we observed that these
disparity compensations can be executed concurrently for
both views. First, inspired from the recent progresses
in the stereo matching methods [9, 20, 50], the disparity
compensation module between left and right views can be
greatly simplified, compared to complex motion compensation schemes in LSVC [10]. This module is integrated into both the codec and hypercodec [5, 42], which
enables data-dependent optimization of the cross-view mutual information. By following this approach, we replace
the sequential disparity compensation with a parallel coding network that can exploit cross-view mutual information
in a “disparity-agnostic” fashion. We introduce a
novel component, BiShiftMod (Bidirectional Shifting Module), which facilitates the connections and information exchange between views in our network. This codec’s development is grounded in two
key insights.

Finally, we show that our solution significantly improves the R-D performance compared to the state-of-the-art method on three popular stereo video benchmarks, with 50.6% BD rate savings on the CityScapes dataset [11], 18.2% on the KITTI 2012 dataset [17], and 15.8% on the KITTI 2015 dataset [41]. Furthermore, we provide a study on the complexity and inference time of neural networks and show that our model has only 35% of the complexity of LSVC [10] in terms of FLOPS. We further downscale each design decision to show the contribution of the proposed modules to the final R-D performance. The contributions of this paper include:
• A novel low-latency neural stereo video codec architecture that replaces sequential inter-view compensation
with an efficient and parallelizable learning module to connect parallel autoencoders
• A bidirectional shift module that effectively captures and exposes redundancy between inter-view features
• A set of thorough experiments demonstrating that our
method is fast and efficient, achieving comparable and
often better results than state-of-the-art methods

The main advantage of neural codecs is that they learn compression from sample data, while handcrafted codecs require expert development. This allows easy adaptation to new domains [21] or even to specific videos or data points [52, 57, 58, 67]. In addition, they can offer advantages from a deployment perspective. In practice, off-the-shelf codecs often use hardware-based implementations to enable efficient operation, especially on mobile devices. However, these implementations typically require a longer deployment process. In contrast, software-based neural codecs only require generic and ubiquitous AI accelerators to operate, making them more flexible and offering the potential to improve various application domains, especially where hardware-based codecs are not available. Finally, neural codecs can be optimized end-to-end to improve perceptual quality by using perceptual loss functions
[1, 18, 40, 43, 66] or to take into account the semantics of the video through region-of-interest coding [8, 15]. Despite these differences, neural video codecs have taken inspiration from handcrafted codecs. Early work used temporal architectures [19, 21, 64], but subsequent work quickly adopted
subnetworks for motion compensation and residual coding
in the low-latency environment [2, 38, 46, 48, 49] and streaming [30, 46]. Recently, neural video codecs have adopted advanced motion compensation [25] and conditional coding techniques, making them competitive with standard codecs in the low-latency environment [35, 36].
2.2. Standard stereo video codecs
Although single-view codecs achieve strong compression performance, their application to the stereo (and more generally multi-view) domain by encoding each view independently would result in a suboptimal linear rate increase. For this reason, early work on image coding extended support to stereo images by using disparity compensation [39, 45]. The idea is to encode one view independently and then predict the other view, for example with motion compensation. Then, the difference between this prediction and the ground truth is quantized and transmitted.

Early works used temporal architectures [19, 21, 64], but follow-up work quickly adopted
subnetworks for motion compensation and residual coding
in the low latency [2, 38, 46, 48, 49] and streaming setting [30, 46]. The main advantage of neural codecs is that they learn to
compress from example data, whereas handcrafted codecs
require expert design. In practice, standard codecs often use hardware-based implementations to enable efficient operation, especially on mobile
devices. However, these implementations tend to require
a longer deployment process. 2.2. Lastly, neural codecs can be optimized end-to-end to improve perceptual quality through the use of perceptual loss functions
[1, 18, 40, 43, 66], or take the semantics of the video into
account via region-of-interest coding [8, 15]. Recently, neural video codecs have adopted
advanced motion compensation techniques [25] and conditional coding, allowing them to become competitive with
standard codecs in the low latency setting [35, 36]. For this
reason, early works in image coding extended support to
stereo images by using disparity compensation [39, 45]. Then, the difference between this prediction and the ground
truth is quantized and transmitted. Standard stereo video codecs
Although single-view codecs achieve strong compression
performance, applying them to the stereo (and more broadly
multi-view) domain by independently coding each view
would lead to a suboptimal linear increase in rate. Despite these
dissimilarities, neural video codecs have taken inspiration
from handcrafted codecs. Additionally, they may provide advantages from a deployment perspective. The idea is to encode one view independently, then predict the other view, for instance, with motion compensation. This allows for easy customization to new domains [21], or even to specific videos or
datapoints [52, 57, 58, 67]. In contrast, software-based
neural codecs only need generic and ubiquitous AI accelerators for operation, making them more flexible and with the
potential to enhance various application domains, especially
where hardware-based codecs are not available.

Parallel AutoEncoders
As shown in Figure 2, LLSS has two pairs of parallel
autoencoders: parallel motion autoencoder and parallel context autoencoder. Each of them runs two parallel autoencoders corresponding to the left and right views. The architecture of each autoencoder is adapted from a state-of-the-art feature-based video codec [25]. Due to space limitations, we refer the reader to the original paper [25] for more details on its architecture. In short, each autoencoder contains a residual-based encoder to convert its input into highly compressible latent material, which is then encoded using a hyperprior network before being decoded back into the expected output via another residual-based decoder.
To improve the information flow within the view, the residual autoencoder, which compresses the residual feature Rt =
Ft ?F¯
t , originally in FVC [25], is replaced by a conditional autoencoder inspired by [35]. In this conditional autoencoder, Ft is fed directly to the encoder, and both encoder
and decoder are conditioned on the distorted feature F¯
t . In addition, F¯
t is fed to the hyper-codec to improve the estimation of the parameters of the previous model.
To improve the information flow between views, we propose the
“Bidirectional Shift Module”. In summary, this block connects the encoder and decoder modules of the left and right branches together to enable the information flow between views, as shown in Figure 4. The next section describes the implementation of this block in detail.
3.2.2 Bidirectional Shift Module
Figure 4 shows the architecture of a bidirectional shift module. It takes as input a pair of inter-view features,
one from each branch of the codec, and outputs a pair of
enhanced features. Inside, the inter-view features
are first transformed into a more representative form of intermediate features via a series of group-based convolutions.
These intermediate features are then shifted via a BiShift(D,S) module. The shifted features are then
passed through a series of group-wise and concatenation-based blocks
to estimate their correlation.

The shifted features are then passed
through a set of Groupwise and Concatenation-based blocks
to estimate their correlation. Inside each of them, there are two
autoencoders running in parallel corresponding to the left
and right views. Parallel AutoEncoders
As illustrated in Figure 2, LLSS has two pairs of parallel
autoencoders: parallel motion autoencoder and parallel
context autoencoder. To enhance the intra-view information flow, the residual autoencoder compressing the residual feature Rt =
Ft ?F¯
t, originally in FVC [25] is replaced by a conditional
autoencoder inspired by [35]. 3.2.2 Bidirectional Shift Module
Figure 4 shows the architecture of a Bidirectional Shift
Module. Inside, the inter-view features will
be first transformed into a more representative form of intermediate features via a set of group-based convolutions. It takes as input a pair of inter-view features,
one from each branch of the codec, and outputs a pair
of enhanced features. Due to the limited space, we would like
to refer the reader to the original paper [25] for more details of its architecture. In summary, this block connects the modules of encoders and decoders of the left and
right branches together to enable the flow of information
across views, as illustrated in Figure 4. The architecture of each single autoencoder is adopted from recent state-of-the-art feature-based
video codec [25]. These intermediate features are then shifted via a module BiShift(D,S). To boost the inter-view information flow, we propose the
“Bidirectional Shift Module”. In this conditional autoencoder, Ft is fed directly into the encoder, and both encoder
and decoder are conditioned on the warped feature F¯
t. Additionally, F¯
t is fed into hyper codec to enhance the estimation of the parameters of the prior model. The next section
details the implementation of this block. Briefly, each autoencoder contains
a residual-based encoder to transform its input into highly
compressible latent, which is then coded with the help of a
hyper prior network before being decoded back to the expected output via another residual-based decoder.

4. Experiments
Datasets. We use 4 different datasets. For training, we use the single-view dataset Vimeo90K [65] for pre-training and then the stereo camera dataset CityScape [11] training set for fine-tuning. For evaluation, we use the Cityscapes test set and the KITTI 2012 [17] and 2015 [41] stereo video datasets.
The CityScapes [11] test dataset includes 1,525 30-frame stereo sequence pairs, each of which contains two streams of size 2048 × 1024. The KITTI 2012 and 2015 test datasets
include 195 and 200 stereo sequence pairs, respectively, each of which contains 21 frames. We follow LSVC data preprocessing [10] for the CityScape and KITTI datasets, all frames are cropped to size 1920 × 704 and 1216 × 320, respectively.
Evaluation metrics. We measure the rate in bits per pixel (BPP) and evaluate reconstruction fidelity using the commonly used metrics Peak Signal-to-Noise Rate (PSNR) and MultiScale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM) [60]. To summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we also report the Bjøntegaard Delta Rate (BD-Rate) [6], which can be interpreted as the average bitrate saving for a fixed quality compared to a reference codec. All evaluations are given in RGB color space. We evaluate our methods
with a Group-of-Picture (GoP) size equal to the total sequence length, i.e. i.e. 30 and 21 frames for the CityScape and KITTI datasets, respectively. For model efficiency, we report the number of parameters along with FLOP and MAC per pixel. We measure the inference GPU time using the torch.cuda.Event() function as well as the torch.cuda.synchronize() function from the official PyTorch library [44], while FLOPs and MACs are calculated using get model profile from the DeepSpeed ​​library [4, 13]. Training details. We implemented our neural stereo video codec using PyTorch [44]. Following a similar strategy as [10], we train our models in 3 phases: First, a single-view version of our model (i.e., without the “BiShiftMod” modules) is randomly initialized. We train the single-view model on the Vimeo90k dataset, taking advantage of its size and diversity. We train 2 million iterations with a learning rate of 5 10?5 and use MSE as the distortion loss. Second, the resulting pre-trained weights from the first stage are used to initialize both branches of the full stereo network. Then, we train the BiShiftMod modules while freezing all other modules. During this step, we train the network for 10,000 iterations on the CityScape dataset with a learning rate of 1 10?5. We found that this step significantly stabilizes the training process. Finally, we optimize the entire network on the CityScape dataset for 200,000 iterations with a learning rate of 1 10?5. When reporting MS-SSIM performance, we use a version of our network further optimized with MS-SSIM as the distortion loss for another 100,000 iterations.

We measure rate in bits-per-pixel ( BPP ) , and assess reconstruction fidelity with the commonly used Peak Signal-to-Noise Rate ( PSNR ) and MultiScale Structural SIMilarity ( MS-SSIM ) [ 60 ] metrics . To summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number , we also report the Bjøntegaard-Delta rate ( BD-rate ) [ 6 ] , which can be interpreted as an average bitrate saving for a fixed quality compared to a reference codec . All scores are reported in the RGB color space . We evaluate our methods with a Group-of-Picture ( GoP ) size equal to the total sequence length i.e. , 30 and 21 frames for the CityScape and KITTI datasets , respectively . For model efficiency , we report the number of parameters along with FLOP and MAC per pixel . We measure the inference GPU time using the function torch.cuda.Event ( ) as well as the function torch.cuda.synchronize ( ) from the official PyTorch library [ 44 ] , while FLOPs and MACs are calculated using get model profile from the DeepSpeed library [ 4 , 13 ] . Training details . We implemented our neural stereo video codec using PyTorch [ 44 ] .

During this step, we
train the network for 10k iterations on the CityScape dataset
with a learning rate of 1·10?5
. Following a similar strategy
to [10], we train our models in 3 stages:
First, a single view version of our model (hence without the “BiShiftMod” modules) is randomly initialized. The KITTI 2012 and 2015
testing datasets include 195 and 200 stereo sequence pairs,
respectively, each containing 21 frames. Finally, we finetune the entire
network on the CityScape dataset for 200k iterations with
a learning rate of 1 · 10?5
. We then train the BiShiftMod modules while freezing all other modules. Evaluation metrics. To
summarize the rate-distortion curve in a single number, we
also report the Bjøntegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) [6], which
can be interpreted as an average bitrate saving for a fixed
quality compared to a reference codec. For training, we use the single-view Vimeo90K dataset [65] for pretraining and then the stereo-camera CityScape dataset [11]
train set for finetuning. For evaluation we use Cityscapes
test set and the stereo-video KITTI 2012 [17] and 2015 [41]
datasets. We train for 2M iterations with a learning rate of 5 · 10?5
, using MSE as distortion loss. For model efficiency, we report the number of parameters along with FLOP and MAC
per pixel. Experiments
Datasets. Second, the resulting pre-trained weights from
the first stage are used to initialize both branches of the
full stereo network. 4. We follow LSVC
[10] data pre-processing for the CityScape and KITTI
datasets, all frames are cropped into size 1920 × 704 and
1216 × 320, respectively. We make use of 4 different datasets. The CityScapes [11] testing dataset comprises 1,525
30-frame stereo sequence pairs, with each containing two
streams of size 2048 × 1024. All scores are reported in the RGB color space. We measure the inference GPU time using the
function torch.cuda.Event() as well as the function
torch.cuda.synchronize() from the official PyTorch
library [44], while FLOPs and MACs are calculated using
get model profile from the DeepSpeed library [4, 13]. We implemented our neural stereo video
codec using PyTorch [44]. We measure rate in bits-per-pixel
(BPP), and assess reconstruction fidelity with the commonly used Peak Signal-to-Noise Rate (PSNR) and MultiScale Structural SIMilarity (MS-SSIM) [60] metrics. We found this step to greatly
stabilize the training process. We evaluate our methods
with a Group-of-Picture (GoP) size equal to the total sequence length i.e., 30 and 21 frames for the CityScape and
KITTI datasets, respectively. When reporting MS-SSIM performance, we use a version of our network which is further finetuned using MS-SSIM as distortion loss for an additional 100k iterations We
train the single view model on the Vimeo90k dataset and
make use of its size and diversity. Training details.

Standard baselines. We compare our work with two standard baselines: H.265 [53] and its multi-view extension MVHEVC [54]. We take the results of the standard codecs from the LSVC paper [10]. For H.265, the HM16.20 implementation [23] is used in the “lowdelay P main” preset for each view independently. MV-HEVC comes from the HTM16.3 implementation [24] with the “baseCfg 2view” preset. Learned baselines. The only stereo video codec learned so far is LSVC by Chen et al. [10]. As with these, we perform a comparison with a single-view codec FVC by Hu et al. [25], in which feature-based warping and residual compensation were introduced and inspired the LSVC architecture. We report the results on H.265, MV-HEVC, FVC and LSVC as recorded in Chen et al. [10]. In addition, we compare with DCVC [34]. Since DCVC did not publish the training codes, we evaluated them without fine-tuning. Therefore, the comparison between our method and DCVC should be interpreted with caution. 4.1. Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods Figure 5 and Table 1 show the rate-distortion curves and BD rate (with MV-HEVC as anchor) of all methods considered on the CityScapes, KITTI 2012 and 2015 test sets, respectively. Our LLSS method outperforms both learned and standard state-of-the-art methods. On the CityScape dataset, our method achieves 50.6% BD rate savings compared to MV-HEVC, while LSVC only saves 32.7%. On the 2012 and 2015 KITTI datasets, our method achieves BD rate savings of 18.2% and 15.8%, respectively. Note that on KITTI datasets, the gap in R-D performance over LSVC has narrowed. We tested our method on the KITTI datasets without fine-tuning, after LSVC. However, the KITTI and CityScapes datasets have different data distributions due to camera settings and baselines as well as image processing settings. These differences lead to significant deviations in the BPP and PSNR ranges when applying conventional and data-driven method codecs. In particular, all neural codecs based on training data tend to underperform in this setting. Despite these challenges, our LLSS method still achieves comparable and often better results than all existing conventional and neural codecs. Compared to LSVC, our method achieves a BD rate improvement of 1.1% and 2.4% over KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, respectively, while being significantly faster. This demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method and its potential to further improve its performance in the future with more general datasets.

We obtain the results of the standard codecs
from the LSVC [10] paper. We tested our method on the
KITTI datasets without finetuning, following LSVC. Especially all
neural codecs relying on training data so tend to be less performant in this setting. These differences lead to significant
variations in BPP and PSNR ranges when applying conventional and data-driven methods codecs. Like them, we include a
comparison to a single-view codec FVC by Hu et al. [25],
in which feature-based warping and residual compensation
were introduced and inspired LSVC architecture. Besides, we also compare with
DCVC [34]. Our LLSS method outperforms both learned
and standard state-of-the-art methods. On the
KITTI 2012 and 2015 datasets, our method attains 18.2%
and 15.8% BD-rate savings, respectively. On the CityScape
dataset, our method achieves 50.6% BD-rate savings compared to MV-HEVC, while LSVC only saved 32.7%. Despite these challenges, our LLSS
method still achieves comparable and often better results
than all existing conventional and neural codecs. The only learned stereo video codec to
date is LSVC by Chen et al. We report the scores of H.265, MV-HEVC, FVC, and LSVC as
recorded in Chen et al. Standard Baselines. 4.1. We compare our work to two standard
baselines: H.265 [53] and its multi-view extension MVHEVC [54]. For H.265, it uses the HM16.20 [23] implementation in the “lowdelay P main” preset
on each view independently. [10]. Therefore, the comparison between our method with DCVC should be interpreted
with a grain of salt. Learned Baselines. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
Figure 5 and Table 1 respectively show the rate-distortion
curves and BD-rate (with MV-HEVC as anchor) of all methods considered on the CityScapes, KITTI 2012 and 2015
test sets. MV-HEVC is from the HTM16.3 implementation [24] with “baseCfg 2view” preset. [10]. Compared
to LSVC, our method obtains an improvement of 1.1% and
2.4% BD-rate gain on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, respectively, while being much faster. This demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method and
its potential to further improve its performance in the future
with more generalized datasets. Since DCVC didn’t release the training codes,
we evaluated it without finetuning. Note that for KITTI datasets, the gap in R-D performance to LSVC has tightened. However, KITTI and CityScapes datasets have different data distributions due to camera settings and baselines, and image
processing settings.

. Computational Complexity Study
In this study, we evaluate the complexity of the transmitter and receiver components. The transmitter includes the entire network as it performs both encoding and decoding operations to create the bitstreams.
However, the receiver only includes the previous frame feature extractor, parallel motion decoding module, motion compensation, parallel context decoding module, and image reconstructor. As stated in Section 4, note that LSVC does not report complexity numbers.
Therefore, we reimplemented its architecture to obtain the complexity numbers.
We reduced the complexity of our method by observing that the pixel shift in cross-view disparity of a pair of stereo images is simpler and more predictable than that caused by temporal motion. When compressing temporal motion and disparity cross-views, LSVC requires large and complex networks (MRC and DRC). Our method simplifies this considerably by designing an efficient BiShiftMod to align features cross-view. In the supplementary section, we showed that our BiShiftMod accounts for only a small fraction of the overall computational complexity. Thanks to BiShiftMod, our parallel autoencoders are designed to be leaner and more efficient. We investigate the complexity of the sender and receiver in terms of inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and multiply-add cumulation (MACs). To investigate how these metrics perform at different video sizes, we crop the videos to sizes 128×128, 256×128, 256×256, 512×256, 512×512, and 768×512. Our experiments are performed on a single Nvidia 3080 GPU with a batch size of 1. We report the complexity for a pair of stereo P-frames and compare our method with the state-of-the-art stereo video compression approach LSVC [10]. As shown in Figure 6, our method successfully reduces the computational complexity across all studied metrics. For example, considering a pair of stereo frames of size 512 × 512, our transmitter achieves 1.7 times faster inference time than LSVC, while our receiver is 1.9 times faster. In terms of FLOPs, LSVC has 2.8 times and 3.2 times higher complexity for the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Similarly, for MACs, LSVC has 2.8 times and 3.3 times higher complexity for the transmitter and receiver, respectively.

Due to
BiShiftMod, our parallel autoencoders have been designed
to be more streamlined and efficient. Our method
greatly simplifies this by designing an efficient BiShiftMod to align features cross-view. We reduced the complexity of our method by observing that the pixel displacement in cross-view disparity of a
pair of stereo frames is simpler and more predictable than
the one caused by temporal motion. Our experiments are conducted on a single Nvidia 3080
GPU, with a batch size of 1. The receiver however only encompasses the feature extractor for previous frames, the parallel motion decoding module, the motion compensation, the parallel context decoding module, and the image reconstructor. In terms of FLOPs, LSVC exhibits
2.8× and 3.2× times higher complexity for the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Similarly, for MACs, LSVC
demonstrates 2.8× and 3.3× times higher complexity for
the transmitter and receiver, respectively Computational complexity study
In this study, we evaluate the complexity of both the transmitter and receiver components. In the supplementary,
we showed that our BiShiftMod accounts for only a small
fraction of the overall computational complexity. We examine the complexity of the transmitter and receiver in terms of inference time, FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs), and Multiply-Add Cumulation (MACs). When compressing
temporal motion and disparity cross views, LSVC requires
large and complex networks (MRC and DRC). . To
investigate how these metrics perform for various video
sizes, we crop the videos to the sizes including 128 × 128, 256×128, 256×256, 512×256, 512×512, and 768×512. The transmitter encompasses the entire network, as both encoding and decoding
operations are carried out in order to create the bit streams. For instance, considering a pair of stereo
frames of size 512 × 512, our transmitter achieves an inference time 1.7× times faster than LSVC, while our receiver
is 1.9× times quicker. As illustrated in Figure 6, our method successfully reduces computational complexity across all examined metrics. As stated in Section 4, note that LSVC does not report complexity numbers,
hence we re-implemented their architecture in order to get
the complexity numbers. We report the complexity

Effectiveness of BiShiftMod. We evaluate the effectiveness of BiShiftMod by conducting tests with the codec and hypercodec. When training the network without BiShiftMod, we skip the second training step. Figure 7 shows that BiShiftMod significantly improves the rate-distortion (RD) performance on the CityScape dataset. In particular, deploying BiShiftMod on the codec and hypercodec resulted in BD rate savings of 7.3% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the configuration without BiShiftMod. When applied to the entire network, BiShiftMod achieves a BD rate reduction of 13.0%. These improvements are due to BiShiftMod's robust ability to reduce rates, highlighting the effectiveness of our BiShiftMod architecture. Effectiveness of BiShiftMod components. We remove the component from BiShiftMod including group-wise correlation (CroupCor) and concatenation-based correlation (CatCor). Figure 7 shows the RD curve on the cityscape dataset. Both GroupCor and CatCor improve the results. Removing GroupCor and CatCor leads to an increase in BD rate by 3.7% and 4.3%, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our network architecture. Effectiveness of parallel features. We concatenate the left and right features into a single feature. Figure 7 shows that our approach using parallel feature streams achieves a BD rate saving of 62% compared to using a single shared feature. Our approach of partitioning features into views and explicitly modeling their redundancy between views is more effective than simply asking a network to perform all these operations implicitly, which is consistent with the many other works on monocular video compression tasks, where compressing frames without modeling motion tends to consume more bits.

When training the network without BiShiftMod, we skip the second training step. Our approach to split features into views and explicitly model their
cross-view redundancy is more effective than simply asking a network to perform all of these operations implicitly,
which is consistent with the many other works on monocular video compression tasks that compressing frames without modeling the motion tends to spend more bits. Effectiveness of the BiShiftMod. Figure 7 shows the RD curve on the cityscape
dataset. Figure 7 shows that
our paralleled feature streams approach achieves 62% BDrate saving compared to using single shared feature. Both GroupCor and CatCor improve the results. Effectiveness of parallel feature. These improvements can be attributed
to BiShiftMod’s robust ability to reduce rates, highlighting
the efficacy of our BiShiftMod architecture. When
applied to the entire network, BishiftMod achieves 13.0%
BD-rate reduction. We remove
the component from BishftMod, including the groupwise
correlation (CroupCor) and concatenation-based correlation
(CatCor). Specifically, employing BishiftMod on the codec and hypercodec lead to BD-rate savings of 7.3% and 6.1% compared
to the configuration without BishftMod, respectively. Figure 7
demonstrates that BiShiftMod significantly enhances the
rate-distortion (RD) performance on the CityScape dataset. Removing GroupCor and CatCor results in 3.7% and 4.3%

Latent feature visualization. Figure 8 shows the latent features of the left and right branches with the highest average energies of the top 8. We compare the differences between the left and right branches. The first two rows are from the model without BiShiftMod, while the bottom two rows are from the model with BiShiftMod. Without BiShiftMod, the latent features appear very similar. However, when BiShiftMod is present, the latent features are less similar, suggesting that BiShiftMod successfully reduces the redundancy between the left and right branches. 5. Conclusion We present a low-latency neural stereo video compression method designed to compress left and right views simultaneously. To this end, we develop a bidirectional shift compression network. The bidirectional shift module captures the redundancy between the left and right frames effectively and efficiently. Our experiments show that
our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, the experiments show that our
bidirectional shift module and parallel autoencoders contribute to reduced bitrates and improved frame quality.

Conclusion
We present a low-latency neural stereo video compression
method designed to simultaneously compress left and right
views. We compare the differences between the left and right branches. Visualization of latent features. 5. Figure 8 displays the latent features from the left and right branches with the top8 largest average energy. The first two rows are
from the model without BiShiftMod, while the bottom two
rows are from the model with BiShiftMod. Acknowledgements We thank Auke Wiggers, Reza Pourreza for their insightful feedback. Furthermore, the experiments show that our
bidirectional-shift module and parallel autoencoders contribute to the reduced bit rates and improved frame quality. The bidirectional-shift module effectively and efficiently captures the redundancy between
the left and right frames. In the absence of
BiShiftMod, the latent features appear very similar. Our experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art
approaches. We develop a bidirectional-shift compression network for this purpose. However, when BiShiftMod is present, the latent features become less alike, indicating that BiShiftMod successfully reduces redundancy between the left and right branches. Additionally, we thank
Wenyu Xia for providing the voiceover in our video demo.
