# Backend Dependencies and Setup

## Activity Engine Setup

### Step 1: Server and Database Setup
- Create Express.js server for activity engine
- Configure PostgreSQL database connection
- Set up necessary database models and schemas

### Step 2: Authentication Routes
Create the following API endpoints:
- GET /auth/token - Retrieve stored access token
- POST /auth/token - Store new access token 
- PUT /auth/token - Upda te existing access token
- DELETE /auth/token - Remove access token

### Step 3: LMS Engine Integration
Update LMS engine to:
- Make POST request to activity engine when user logs in
- Make DELETE request to activity engine when user logs out
- Make PUT request to update token if user logs in while already having active session

## Implementation Notes
- All routes should be properly authenticated
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow RESTful API best practices
- Ensure database transactions are atomic
