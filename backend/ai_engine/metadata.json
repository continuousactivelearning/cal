{"Learn Machine Learning Like a GENIUS and Not Waste Time": [{"content": "so you want to learn machine learning and you somehow ended up here well I've got good news and bad news the bad news I'm not here to sell you some become an ml engineer in 3 months fantasy could it happen sure people also win the lottery the good news I've been exactly where you are about 8 years ago I thought I knew enough Basics to just apply for jobs and learn the rest while working spoiler alert I failed miserably but those failures taught me exactly what works and what doesn't and that's what I'm sharing today I've since taught all of this to hundreds of students in several countries so I think I have a good idea on what works and what doesn't hopefully I can save you months of frustration by showing you the smart way to learn machine learning learning data science was one of the best decisions I ever made and most of you can do it and you will learn some cool stuff on the way that even if you don't become a data scientist or machine learning engineer you will have learned programming how to build apps how to analyze and visualize data you will have strong statistics and research skills and be able to communicate data clearly many amazing job options will be open to you even if you don't become a data scientist but you will have to work hard but what should you work hard on and how do we even start that's what I'm here to tell you learning how to learn before we even touch machine learning let's talk about something crucial learning how to learn why because machine learning and AI like most things in Tech are constantly evolving and what matters isn't just what you know but how quickly you can adapt and learn new things a little secret I actually suck at at programming and algorithms but I am really good at learning new stuff here's why this matters specifically for machine learning technology changes fast new platforms and Frameworks drop constantly and new papers come out daily what's hot today might be obsolete tomorrow problem solving is everything machine learning isn't about memorizing algorithms it's about understanding data and patterns about breaking down complex problems and finding Creative Solutions confidence AKA don't get overwhelmed or scared of big problems people who know how to learn and problem solve don't get paralyzed when faced with a new big problem they develop a strategy for how to look at a new problem and break it down into manageable problems they have faced before they know how to look up Solutions and find tools necessary to solve new problems they adapt more quickly when Tech changes efficiency if you know how to learn you won't waste time on unnecessary things time is money learn what you actually need to get where you want to be there's no one size fits all solution for learning something it depends on your style of learning but also on your goals not everyone needs to learn everything so how do you learn how to learn this one you kind of have to figure out for yourself because what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for the next some people learn well with graphs and diagrams others with text others maybe with voice notes some people need to understand the theory before applying it others need to jump right in and use an algorithm before asking what it actually does in this video I will try to show you what worked for me while giving you resources that I believe will get you there as quickly as possible I will just mention a principle that has helped me a lot throughout my career the the Paro principle sometimes called 8020 principle it says that 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort constantly ask yourself why am I doing this is this actually getting me where I want to be or can I do something more useful with my time well the answer to this question isn't always the same for everyone I will try to now give you the 20% of the work that would have gotten me 80% of the way to becoming a data scientist adapt as needed but where do I start now let's build your machine Learning Foundation the right way here's your road map python while the next skill is at least as important I would start with learning python the main reason is that you will get a feeling of achievement fairly quickly and python is super simple why python python is the main language of data analytics data science and machine learning while also being a full-fledged programming language allowing you to write scripts build apps and websites and much more python will allow you to actually start writing real code within days without having to learn super complicated computer science Concepts like pointers memory allocation and garbage collection also with python you will be able to get a job as a programmer or data analyst or web developer even if you don't learn all the hard machine learning stuff I suggest you first install jupyter notebooks as they make learning much easier and jupyter notebooks are also a core tool for data analysts and data scientists all over the world then learn about these Core Concepts programming fundamentals basic syntax indentation rules comments and so on variables math if else Loops printing data types like strings ins floats booleans lists dictionaries functions classes and objects modules packages and importing do a pandas tutorial pandas is Python's primary data manipulation Library built for handling tabular data through data frame objects imagine it as Excel spreadsheets on steroids it will be your main tool for data analysis cleaning and transformation with powerful functions for merging reshaping and analyzing data the library strength lies in combining the power of numpy arrays with spreadsheet like functionality and SQL database like joints it also comes with built-in plotting functionality built on top of Python's powerful met plot lib libraries pandas is a true data analysis Powerhouse if you truly Master pandas you will excel at most data analysis positions in the world also because exploratory data analysis and data preparation are about 60 to 80% of a data scientist job it will also lay the foundation for that 8020 principle remember your First Data analysis project so before you get into any machine learning I would take the time here to work on an actual project to deepen your python pandas and data analysis knowledge as I mentioned in my previous videos real projects beat tutorials at developing a good data scientist find some data you want to analyze maybe from one of your old jobs or school maybe you can export some data from your favorite health tracker or ask some friends if they have some data they want analyzed or maybe download public data from the government the World Bank or a nonprofit any topic you're interested in it could be economics Sports politics video games the board games this last one was a passion of one of my former students work on importing the data into pandas clean up the data make the units uniform decide what to do about missing data and outliers plot the different variables look at correlations between variables and come up with some hypothesis about the data and test them by making more plots turn your results into a slideshow with nice graphs that tell a story that you can present to friends and family Pro tip Jupiter notebooks with data and plots can be turned directly into a slideshow this will also be the first project for your port portfolio which you can show when applying for jobs as a data analyst essential math for machine learning this might be the part that most of you fear the most but I think it is the most important part for anyone wanting to learn machine learning you should take this seriously you don't need to be a math genius or know about all of math to become good at machine learning but you need to really understand the Core Concepts from the areas I'm about to mention for more details on math for machine learning check out my video on the topic basic statistics and probability this for me is the most important Branch as a data analyst and data scientist now there are many online resources for statistics but I highly suggest taking the Con Academy statistics and probability course this course is completely free and is the one I took when I prepared for my first job as a data scientist the full course is probably around 50 hours of content so if you have prior math knowledge you probably won't spend more than 100 hours on this but it might take you longer that's around 2 3 weeks of full-time self-study more if much of this is completely new to you but please take the time to do this it will make everything that follows so much easier and save you much more than 100 hours of headaches later on ideally while you learn new Concepts here you go to your data set from the previous data analysis project phase and try to apply them there to deepen your intuition linear algebra fundamentals while also important linear algebra for machine learning is much more about learning some tools and rules this should be much quicker than learning probability and statistics Concepts the main thing you want to learn is how to operate with vectors and matrices and learn what the different operations mean this is more about mathem iCal tools and notations than Concepts I think learning this will take about a quarter to a third of the time it took you to learn the statistics Concepts so one or two weeks of studying should be enough for people with prior math knowledge I will also leave the link to the Khan Academy linear algebra course in the description calculus here again it's about learning some tools but also understanding what derivatives are conceptually and how they help in optimization problems you should really understand how functions and their derivatives work and know the basic rules of differentiation like the chain rule I would again calculate with one or two weeks if you have prior math knowledge I will also leave a con Academy Link in the description Pro tip you need working knowledge not a math PhD focus on intuition over proofs spend most your time on statistical concepts for linear algebra and calculus focus on learning the tools like Matrix operations and how to take the derivative of a function the core machine learning Concepts and algorithms now here's where many people mess up they jump straight to Deep learning but that's a mistake in my opinion you should spend most of your time on simple algorithms the reasons for that are manifold and discussed in my previous videos but basically many problems don't require complicated solution simple algorithms like linear regression are quicker to run they're more generalizable more interpretable and easier to learn from and communicate and more importantly these algorithms form the basis for the more complicated algorithms like neural networks so truly understanding them will help you understand the more complicated algorithms better too check out my video on machine learning algorithms but basically before getting into neural networks or even svm make sure you understand how linear regression and logistic regression work then look at decision trees and Ensemble algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting I learned most of these topics from the book an introduction to statistical learning the majority of you will prefer learning from videos so just watch the Youtube video series about this book by the authors themselves completely for free on YouTube I will leave a link in the description all the videos together are about 20 hours but since you will want to pause and take notes and read up on certain Concepts I think this will be another 100 hours or so of study time so that should be another two or more weeks of full-time self-study all these numbers are estimates as everyone learns at different speeds do a scikit learn tutorial scit learn is the number one machine learning library in the world for basic machine learning algorithms you can do a basic sklearn tutorial in a day or two and the good thing is that the simple and consistent syntax makes it such that once you know how to use the library for one algorithm you know how to use it for any algorithm as long as you know what algorithm is meant for what which you now know because you just learned it pyit learn also comes with great documentation and toy data sets to play around with I suggest you start using psyit learn while you are learning about the algorithms in the statistical learning course the genius move while you learn about the theory behind new algorithms for example going through the statistical learning course and starting with linear regression Implement and use the algorithm in the following three three ways implemented from scratch using basic python implemented using scikit learn using a toy data set then use both your own implementation and the syit learn toolkit to try out the algorithm on a real data set that you have prepared yourself now there's a common Pitfall that many beginners get stuck in tutorial hell it's where you essentially just keep following tutorials without striking out on your own and actually building something most learning comes from the trial and error of building an application so if you always follow a tutorial you get Stu at a basic level how do you not get stuck there do just one or two tutorials per area Max and then work on a real project your first machine learning project here you can either continue with your data analysis project from before or find a new more interesting data set for a machine learning project but don't forget to still use pandas to do an exploratory data analysis to prepare your data for modeling and form hypothesis about your data more often than not the goal of a machine learning project will be to predict some variable from other variables research the industry of your project a bit look at the data and make some hypothesis about what might influence your target variable either based on intuition about the industry or from looking at correlations and Scatter Plots of different variables design new features based on your knowledge of the problem then start modeling but start with simple algorithms like linear regression logistic regression and decision trees then move on to more complex algorithms like svm random forests or gradient boosting note how as complexity increases accuracy usually increases but interpretability decreases your goal is usually to find a sweet spot also don't forget over fitting as you increase in model complexity keep validation and test sets aside before starting to model and compare your models using the test set at the very end many times the more complex algorithms don't look as good anymore once you use the final test set it might be a good idea to work with data sets that have been published on sites like kaggle to then compare your Solutions and accuracies to other people's Solutions and get an idea of how well your models are in comparison to others but don't get frustrated a lot of people on kaggle are professionals with years of experience if you get anywhere close in accuracy you should be happy don't know what to work on you can start with a tutorial but instead of following it directly after building the core features add some features change some features swap out the data set and try to break your code and then fix it this is one of the best ways to learn while not getting stuck in tutorial hell collaborate and share your projects with others learning ML and isolation is the slowest way to learn instead find coding buddies to work on a project with present your work to friends and family or post it publicly on GitHub or in machine learning communities have someone more advanced than you give you feedback this will speed up your learning 10 times don't know anyone to work on a project with participate in a hackathon or write to people with similar interests on kaggle GitHub Discord Reddit LinkedIn Etc the connections you form this way will not only help you learn better but boost your career in unexpected ways check out my most recent video to learn more about the importance of networking and data science Advanced topics only now should you look at more advanced topics deep learning architectures cnns for computer vision RNN for sequential data or Transformers for NLP Advanced optimization techniques model deployment strategies and the latest research papers remember learn these by need not by fomo you don't need to know everything just learn these techniques if they are important to your project here some dos and don'ts don't don't get stuck in tutorial hell don't try to memorize everything don't learn in isolation don't chase every new trend don't copypaste code without understanding don't try to learn every new fancy tool or research paper instead build real projects focus on understanding share your progress join communities Master fundamentals first Implement from scratch learn by doing if you found

I'll be walking you through five beginner friendly AWS Cloud projects now as I've said on this channel over and over again the best way to build your Hands-On skills with AWS is by creating a project certifications are a great starting point but to really bridge that gap between your theoretical knowledge and what's required to Le a job in the cloud it's important for you to think about how you can use multiple AWS Services together to build a solution this solution could be a static website a mobile application or even a chat bot that can respond to simple queries the possibilities are endless but the problem is how do you get started should you read through hundreds of pages of documentation first or should you just jump straight into it and hope for the best well to be honest there's no one correct approach when starting a cloud project Some people prefer to follow a step-by-step tutorial While others might want the flexibility to build something without the exact instructions already provided to them my personal preference and what I recommend to beginners is to follow guided tutorials for your first few Cloud projects more importantly learn how to document them and speak about your projects during Cloud interviews and so over the next few months I'll be releasing a series of videos to help you build AWS Cloud projects at three different skill levels beginner intermediate and advanced if you want to stay updated make sure you subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications all right let's just dive straight into it the first beginner Cloud project is to build a daily task schedule application using party rock this platform allows you to create an application by simply describing what you want making it a great choice for beginners looking to build AI applications to get started visit party Rock's website and create an account select the build your own app option and this will open up an interface for you to create your own application now you might be wondering what can party rock actually be used for well as cheesy as it sounds the possibilities are endless you can create applications for your own personal use such as a to-do list or Resume Builder you could also create an application for your workplace such as a project management tool with Party Rock people have even built things like motivational quote generators and personality quizzes if you'd like to learn how to build a daily task schedule application I've included the full tutorial in the description below I've also created a guide book with the complete step-by-step instructions to all five projects in this video so feel free to check that out as well but yeah here are the overall steps you need to take if you'd like to build it out so start by entering a detailed prompt that describes the daily task schedule application you envision make sure you're descriptive enough so that partyy rock can understand exactly what you want once you submit your prompt the AI gets to work creating an application that fits your needs after the application is generated you'll be introduced to the customization process this gives you the option to add widgets like user input static text image generation and even a chatbot you can also change the layout of your application to match your brand or personal preferences once you finalize your application you can publish it and share it with others the estimated time for this project is around 15 to 20 minutes but of course it all depends on how complex you want your application to be be and how many features you'd like the cost for this project is $0 since party rock is offering all users a free trial to their service all right project number two is to build an image labels generator using Amazon recognition now this project is another fun one because we'll be processing images and labeling them for example if you have a photo of a cat amaz recognition will be able to identify what it is and label the image as a cat as mentioned I have the complete guide book for all five projects in the description below but here's the architectural diagram and the overall steps you'll need to take to build out the project so the Journey Begins with setting up an Amazon S3 bucket which will serve as the repository for the images you wish to analyze next you'll create an IM am roll and make sure Amazon recognition and S3 have access to each other after that you'll need to install the AWS C and write some code to use the detect labels option for images and finally use a python Library called map plot Li to visualize labels and add bounding boxes to items identified in the images this is the result of what one of your images could look like you could see that one use case of Amazon recognition could be in a smart surveillance system to recognize suspicious objects and activities on the road other potential use cases include identifying products in a store for inventory management analyzing customer behavior on retail stores and providing accessibility options to those who are visually impaired as you can probably tell Amazon recognition is a pretty useful service that can be applied in many Industries so I would recommend building a project to get some experience with it and to see it in action the project will take you about 20 minutes to build and Falls within the free tier now before we move on to the next project I'd like to share with you a helpful tool that will significantly help you on your journey of building AWS Cloud projects some of you might have heard of M before they're a platform that offers an innovation workspace for teams to collaborate well miror has recently released a really cool feature called AWS Cloud view AWS Cloud view allows you to instantly visualize your Cloud architecture by directly importing data from your aw account creating a clear view in just 20 seconds as you all know architectural diagrams are a very important part of documenting every cloud project so instead of manually creating your own diagrams you can create them with the help of miror here's how you can use mirror's edu as Cloud view first either link a cross account roll or upload a Json file containing data about your AWS resources next follow the instructions to select the relevant account and region you wish to visualize and finally sit back while they generate the diagram here's an example AWS diagram generated through Cloud view if you're looking to present your Cloud projects professionally or just want a faster way to create Cloud architectures AWS Cloud view in Miro is a complete Game Changer I'll leave a link to it in the description below moving on to the third project this one is to develop a text narrator using Amazon poly now Amazon poly is a service that turns text to speech allowing you to create an application that can talk now this is great when you don't feel like reading something and just want to listen to the audio version one example is is converting a blog post into an audio book here's the architectural diagram for the project and the steps you need to take so firstly find a piece of text that you'd like spoken out this could be anything from books and articles to newsletters and scripts next create an AWS Lambda function that acts as a bridge between your text and Amazon poly after that customize the voice in Amazon poly to match the tone and style of your content adjusting parameters like pitch and speed now even though this project may seem simple it does require a good understanding of AWS services and how to integrate them it also gives you a taste of how powerful text to speech capabilities can be in enhancing customer experience the estimated time to complete this project is 20 minutes and it also falls within the free tier the fourth Cloud project to help you get highed in 2024 is to build a language translation Bard this project uses three AWS Services AWS Lambda Amazon Lex and Amazon translate so for example if you want to translate a word or sentence into another language all you have to do is type into the chat bot and it will output the translation sounds straightforward enough right here's the architectural diagram and the steps you need to take firstly create a chatbot in Amazon Lex and Define clear user intents next specify utterances or phrases that users might say to interact with your Bot once that's done Define slots within the intents such as language or text to capture the specific information needed for the translation after that we're going to need a Lambda function that takes the slot data and perform a translation using Amazon trans translate and finally we'll integrate the Lambda function back into the Amazon Lex chatbot and deliver the translation smoothly to the user some potential use cases of an Amazon Lex translation bot include assisting businesses in communicating with International clients and helping Travelers communicate with locals from different languages you might be wondering why can't I use a translation app that has already been made well the answer is that businesses often require customized translation services especially when dealing with technical terms or industry specific language by using Amazon Lex you have the flexibility to tailor your Bot based on your specific needs overall building a language translation bot not only showcases your knowledge of using AWS services but is also a skill set for companies looking to build chatbots this project will take you about 1 to 2 hours to build and can be done for free through the aeds free tier the fifth and final project for today is to deploy a bucket list tracker application on AWS amplify this project once you build it out will help you keep a track of all the things you want to do in life you can enter bucket list items and delete them once they're complete now you can see that the architectural diagram for this project looks a bit more complex than the other ones and that's because we'll need multiple ads services to build this application the first step is to build your application with react focusing on userfriendly design and functionality that allows users to manage the bucket list items effectively next initialize a GitHub repo and connect your local development environment to GitHub after that use AWS amplifier to host your front end and Implement amplifier authentication to to add user authentication features like login and sign up once that's done develop the back end using AWS appsync and a graph Cur API for efficient data handling you can then integrate it with Dynamo DB for data storage finally deploy your application on AWS amplify test it out and make any necessary adjustments like all the other projects mentioned in this video this one Falls within the free tier however this final project will take you a bit longer to build around 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours and there you have it five AWS Cloud projects to help you get handson get hired and Advance your career if you found this video helpful please remember to give it a like and let me know in the comments which project was your favorite I'd also recommend checking out this video I made on how to document your AWS Cloud projects thanks so much for watching and I'll see you soon bye for now"}], "Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 01 \"THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER\"": [{"content": "Funding for this program is provided by: Additional funding provided by This is a course about Justice and we begin\nwith a story suppose you're the driver of a trolley car, and your trolley car is hurdling down\nthe track at sixty miles an hour and at the end of the track you notice\nfive workers working on the track you tried to stop but you can't your brakes don't work you feel desperate because you know that if you crash into these five workers they will all die let's assume you know that for sure and so you feel helpless until you notice that there is off to the right a side track at the end of that track there's one worker working on track you're steering wheel works so you can turn the trolley car if you want to onto this side track killing the one but sparing the five. Here's our first question what's the right thing to do? What would you do? Let's take a poll, how many would turn the trolley car onto the side track? How many wouldn't? How many would go straight ahead keep your hands up, those of you who'd go straight\nahead. A handful of people would, the vast majority\nwould turn let's hear first now we need to begin to investigate the reasons\nwhy you think it's the right thing to do. Let's begin with\nthose in the majority, who would turn to go onto side track? Why would you do it, what would be your reason?"}, {"content": "Who's willing to volunteer a reason? Go ahead, stand up. Because it can't be right to kill five people\nwhen you can only kill one person instead. it wouldn't be right to kill five if you could kill one person instead that's a good reason that's a good reason who else? does everybody agree with that reason? go ahead. Well I was thinking it was the same reason it was on 9/11 we regard the people who flew the plane who flew the plane into the Pennsylvania field as heroes because they chose to kill the people on the\nplane and not kill more people in big buildings. So the principle there was the same on 9/11 it's tragic circumstance, but better to kill one so that five can\nlive is that the reason most of you have, those\nof you who would turn, yes? Let's hear now from those in the minority those who wouldn't turn. Well I think that same type of mentality that\njustifies genocide and totalitarianism in order to save one type of race you\nwipe out the other. so what would you do in this case? You would to avoid the horrors of genocide you would crash into the five and kill them? Presumably yes."}, {"content": "okay who else?"}, {"content": "That's a brave answer, thank you. Let's consider another trolley car case and see whether those of you in the majority want to adhere to the principle, better that one should die so that five\nshould live. This time you're not the driver of the trolley\ncar, you're an onlooker standing on a bridge overlooking a trolley car track and down the track comes a trolley car at the end of the track are five workers the brakes don't work the trolley car is about to careen into the\nfive and kill them and now you're not the driver you really feel helpless until you notice standing next to you leaning over the bridge is it very fat man. And you could give him a shove he would fall over the bridge onto the track right in the way of the trolley car he would die but he would spare the five. Now, how many would push the fat man over the bridge? Raise your hand. How many wouldn't? Most people wouldn't. Here's the obvious question, what became of the principle better to save five lives even if it means\nsacrificing one, what became of the principal that almost everyone endorsed in the first case I need to hear from someone who was in the\nmajority in both cases is how do you explain the difference between\nthe two? The second one I guess involves an\nactive choice of  pushing a person and down which I guess that that person himself would otherwise not \nhave been involved in the situation at all and so to choose on his behalf I guess to  involve him in something that he otherwise would\nhave this escaped is I guess more than what you have in the first case where the three parties, the driver and the two sets of workers are already I guess in this situation. but the guy working, the one on the track\noff to the side he didn't choose to sacrifice his life any\nmore than the fat guy did, did he? That's true, but he was on the tracks. this guy was on the bridge. Go ahead, you can come back if you want. Alright, it's a hard question but you did well you did very well it's a\nhard question. who else can find a way of reconciling the reaction of the majority in these two cases? Yes? Well I guess in the first case where you have the one worker and the five it's a  choice between those two, and you have to  make a certain choice and people are going to die \nbecause of the trolley car  not necessarily because of your direct actions. The trolley car is a runway, thing and you need to make in a split second choice whereas pushing the fat man over is an actual\nact of murder on your part you have control over that whereas you may not have control over the trolley car. So I think that it's a slightly different situation."}, {"content": "Alright who has a reply? Is that, who has a reply to that? no that was good, who has a way who wants to reply? Is that a way out of this? I don't think that's a very good reason because\nyou choose either way you have to choose who dies\nbecause you either choose to turn and kill a person which is an act of conscious thought to turn, or you choose to push the fat man  over which is also an active conscious action so either way you're making a choice. Do you want to reply? Well I'm not really sure that that's the case, it just still\nseems kind of different, the act of actually pushing someone over onto the tracks and killing them, you are actually killing him yourself, you're pushing\nhim with your own hands you're pushing and  that's different than steering something that is going to\ncause death into another...you know it doesn't really sound right saying it now when I'm up here. No that's good, what's your name?"}, {"content": "Andrew. Andrew and let me ask you this question Andrew, suppose standing on the bridge next to the fat man I didn't have to push him, suppose he was standing over a trap door that I could open by turning\na steering wheel like that would you turn it? For some reason that still just seems more  more wrong. I mean maybe if you just accidentally like leaned into\nthis steering wheel or something like that or but,  or say that the car is  hurdling towards a switch that will drop the trap then I could agree with that. Fair enough, it still seems  wrong in a way that it doesn't seem wrong in the\nfirst case to turn, you say An in another way, I mean in the first situation you're\ninvolved directly with the situation in the second one you're an onlooker as well. So you have the choice of becoming involved\nor not by pushing the fat man. Let's forget for the moment about this case, that's good, but let's imagine a different case. This time\nyour doctor in an emergency room and six patients come to you they've been in a terrible trolley car wreck five of them sustained moderate injuries one\nis severely injured you could spend all day caring for the one severely injured victim, but in that time the five would die, or you could\nlook after the five, restore them to health, but during that time the one severely injured person would die. How many would save  the five now as the doctor? How many would save the one? Very few people, just a handful of people. Same reason I assume, one life versus five. Now consider another doctor case this time you're a transplant surgeon and you have five patients each in desperate\nneed of an organ transplant in order to survive on needs a heart one a lung, one a kidney,  one a liver and the fifth a pancreas. And you have no organ donors you are about to see you them die and then it occurs to you that in the next room there's a healthy guy who came in for a checkup. and he is you like that and he's taking a nap you could go in very quietly yank out the five organs, that person would\ndie but you can save the five. How many would do it? Anyone? How many? Put your hands up if you would do it. Anyone in the balcony? You would? Be careful don't lean over too much How many wouldn't? All right. What do you say, speak up in the balcony, you\nwho would yank out the organs, why? I'd actually like to explore slightly alternate possibility of just taking the one of the five he needs an organ who dies first and using their four healthy organs to save the other\nfour That's a pretty good idea. That's a great idea except for the fact that you just wrecked the philosophical point. Let's step back from these stories and these arguments to notice a couple of things about the way the arguments have began to unfold. Certain moral principles have already begun to emerge from the discussions we've had and let's consider what those moral principles look like the first moral principle that emerged from the \ndiscussion said that the right thing to do the moral thing to do depends on the consequences that will result from your action at the end of the day better that five should live even if one must die. That's an example of consequentialist moral reasoning. consequentialist moral reasoning locates morality\nin the consequences of an act. In the state of the  world that will result  from the thing you do but then we went a little further, we considered\nthose other cases and people weren't so sure  about consequentialist moral reasoning when people hesitated to push the fat man over the bridge or to yank out the organs of the innocent patient people gestured towards reasons having to do with the intrinsic quality of the act itself. Consequences be what they may. People were reluctant people thought it was just wrong categorically wrong to kill a person an innocent person even for the sake of saving five lives, at least these people thought that in the second version of each story we reconsidered so this points a second categorical way of thinking about moral reasoning categorical moral reasoning locates morality\nin certain absolute moral requirements in certain categorical duties and rights regardless of the consequences. We're going to explore in the days and weeks to come the contrast\nbetween consequentialist and categorical moral principles. The most influential example of consequential moral reasoning is utilitarianism,\na doctrine invented by Jeremy Bentham, the eighteenth century English\npolitical philosopher. The most important philosopher of categorical moral reasoning is the eighteenth century German philosopher\nEmmanuel Kant. So we will look at those two different modes of moral reasoning assess them and also consider others. If you look at the syllabus, you'll notice\nthat we read a number of great and famous books. Books by Aristotle John Locke Emanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and others. You'll notice too from the syllabus that\nwe don't only read these books, we also all take up contemporary political and legal controversies\nthat raise philosophical questions. We will debate equality and inequality, affirmative action, free speech versus hate speech, same sex marriage, military conscription, a range of practical questions, why not just to enliven these abstract and distant\nbooks but to make clear to bring out what's at stake\nin our everyday lives including our political lives, for philosophy. So we will read these books and we will debate these issues and we'll see how each informs and\nilluminates the other. This may sound appealing enough but here I have to issue a warning, and the warning is this to read these books in this way, as an exercise in self-knowledge, to read them in this way carry certain risks risks that are both personal and political, risks that every student of political philosophy have known. These risks spring from that fact that philosophy teaches us and unsettles us by confronting us with what we already know. There's an irony the difficulty of this course consists in the\nfact that it teaches what you already know. It works by taking what we know from familiar unquestioned settings, and making it strange. That's how those examples worked worked the hypotheticals with which we began with their\nmix of playfulness and sobriety. it's also how these philosophical books work. Philosophy  estranges us from the familiar not by supplying new information but by inviting and provoking a new way of seeing but, and here's the risk, once the familiar turns strange, it's never quite the same again. Self-knowledge is like lost innocence, however unsettling you find it, it can never be unthought or unknown what makes this enterprise difficult but also riveting, is that moral and political philosophy is a story and you don't know where this story will lead\nbut what you do know is that the story is about you. Those are the personal risks, now what of the political risks. one way of introducing of course like this would be to promise you that by reading these books and debating these issues you will become a better more responsible\ncitizen. You will examine the presuppositions of\npublic policy, you will hone your political judgment you'll become a more effective participant\nin public affairs but this would be a partial and misleading promise political philosophy for the most part hasn't\nworked that way. You have to allow for the possibility that political philosophy may make you a worse\ncitizen rather than a better one or at least a worse citizen before it makes you a better one and that's because philosophy is a distancing even debilitating activity And you see this going back to Socrates there's a dialogue, the Gorgias in which one of Socrates\u2019 friends Calicles tries to talk him out of philosophizing. calicles tells Socrates philosophy is a pretty toy if one indulges in it with moderation at\nthe right time of life but if one pursues it further than one should\nit is absolute ruin. Take my advice calicles says, abandon argument learn the accomplishments of active\nlife, take for your models not those people who spend\ntheir time on these petty quibbles, but those who have a good livelihood and reputation and many other blessings. So Calicles is really saying to Socrates quit philosophizing, get real go to business school and calicles did have a point he had a point because philosophy distances us from conventions from established assumptions and from settled beliefs. those are the risks, personal and political and in the face of these risks there is a\ncharacteristic evasion, the name of the evasion is skepticism. It's\nthe idea well it goes something like this we didn't resolve, once and for all, either the cases or the principles we were\narguing when we began and if Aristotle and Locke and Kant and Mill haven't solved these questions\nafter all of these years who are we to think that we here in Sanders Theatre over the\ncourse a semester can resolve them and so maybe it's just a matter of each person having his or her own principles\nand there's nothing more to be said about it no way of reasoning that's the evasion. The evasion of skepticism  to which I would offer the following reply: it's true these questions have been debated for a very\nlong time but the very fact that they have reoccurred and persisted may suggest that though they're impossible in one sense their unavoidable in another and the reason they're unavoidable the reason they're inescapable is that we live\nsome answer to these questions every day. So skepticism, just throwing up their hands\nand giving up on moral reflection, is no solution Emanuel Kant described very well the problem with skepticism\nwhen he wrote skepticism is a resting place for human reason  where it can reflect upon its dogmatic wanderings but it is no dwelling place for permanent settlement. Simply to acquiesce in skepticism, Kant wrote, can never suffice to overcome the restless\nof reason. I've tried to suggest through theses stories\nand these arguments some sense of the risks and temptations of the perils and the possibilities I would\nsimply conclude by saying that the aim of this course is to awaken the restlessness of reason and to see where it might lead thank you very much. Like, in a situation that desperate, you have to do what you have to do to survive. You have to do what you have to do you? You've gotta do What you  gotta do. pretty much,  If you've been going nineteen days without any food someone has to take the sacrifice, someone has to make the sacrifice  \nand people can survive. Alright that's good, what's your name?"}, {"content": "Marcus."}, {"content": "Marcus, what do you say to Marcus? Last time we started out last time with some stores with some moral dilemmas about trolley cars and about doctors and healthy patients vulnerable to being victims of organ transplantation we noticed two things about the arguments we had one had to do with the way we were arguing it began with our judgments in particular cases we tried to articulate the reasons or the\nprinciples lying behind our judgments and then confronted with a new case we found ourselves re-examining those principles revising each in the light of the other and we noticed the built-in pressure to try\nto bring into alignment our judgments about particular cases and the principles we would endorse on reflection we also noticed something about the substance\nof the arguments that emerged from the discussion. We noticed that sometimes we were tempted\nto locate the morality of an act in the consequences in the results, in the state of the world that\nit brought about. We called is consequentialist moral reason. But we also noticed that in some cases we weren't swayed only  by the results sometimes, many of us felt, that not just consequences but also the intrinsic\nquality or character of the act matters morally. Some people argued that there are certain things\nthat are just categorically wrong even if they bring about a good result even if they save five people at the cost of one life. So we contrasted consequentialist moral principles with categorical ones. Today and in the next few days we will begin to examine one of the\nmost influential versions of consequentialist moral theory and that's the philosophy of utilitarianism. Jeremy Bentham, the eighteenth century English political philosopher gave first the first clear systematic expression to the utilitarian moral theory. And Bentham's idea, his essential idea is a very simple one with a lot of  morally intuitive appeal. Bentham's idea is the following the right thing to do the just thing to do it's to maximize utility. What did he mean by utility? He meant by utility the balance of pleasure over pain, happiness over suffering. Here's how we arrived  at the principle of maximizing utility. He started out by observing that all of us all human beings are governed by two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. We human beings like pleasure and dislike pain and so we should base morality whether we are thinking of what to do in our own lives or whether as legislators or citizens we are thinking about what the law should be, the right thing to do individually or collectively is to maximize, act in a way that maximizes the overall level of happiness. Bentham's utilitarianism is sometimes summed\nup with the slogan the greatest good for the greatest number. With this basic principle of utility on hand, let's begin to test it and to examine it by turning to another case another story but this time not a hypothetical story, a real-life story the case of the Queen versus Dudley and Stephens. This was a nineteenth-century British law case that's famous and much debated in law schools. Here's what happened in the case I'll summarize the story and then I want to hear how you would rule imagining that you are the jury. A newspaper account of the time described the background: A sadder story of disaster at sea was never told than that of the survivors of the yacht Mignonette. The ship foundered in the south Atlantic thirteen hundred miles from the cape there were four in the crew, Dudley was the captain Stephens was the first mate Brooks was a sailor, all men of excellent character, or so the newspaper account tells us. The fourth crew member was the cabin boy, Richard Parker seventeen years old. He was an orphan he had no family and he was on his first long voyage at sea. He went, the news account tells us, rather against the advice of his friends. He went in the hopefulness of youthful ambition thinking the journey would make a man of him. Sadly it was not to be, the facts of the case were not in dispute, a wave hit the ship and the Mignonette went down. The four crew members escaped to a lifeboat the only food they had were two cans of preserved turnips no fresh water for the first three days they ate nothing on the fourth day that opened one of the cans of\nturnips and ate it. The next day they caught a turtle together with the other can of turnips  the turtle enabled them to subsist for the next few days and then for eight days they had nothing no food no water. Imagine yourself in a situation like that what would you do? Here's what they did by now the cabin boy Parker is lying at the\nbottom of the lifeboat in a corner because he had drunk sea water against the advice of the others and he had become ill and he appeared to be dying so on the nineteenth day Dudley, the captain, suggested that they should all have a lottery. That they should all draw lots to see who would die to save the rest. Brooks refused he didn't like the lottery idea we don't know whether this was because he didn't want to take that chance\nor because he believed in categorical moral principles but in any case no lots were drawn. The next day there was still no ship in sight so a Dudley told Brooks to avert his gaze  and he motioned to Stephens that the boy Parker had better be killed. Dudley offered a prayer he told a the boy his time had come and he killed him with a pen knife stabbing him in the jugular vein. Brooks emerged from his conscientious objection\nto share in the gruesome bounty. For four days the three of them fed on the body and blood\nof the cabin boy. True story. And then they were rescued. Dudley describes their rescue in his diary with staggering euphemism, quote: \"on the twenty fourth day as we were having our breakfast a ship appeared at last.\" The three survivors were picked up by a German ship. They were taken back to Falmouth in England where they were arrested and tried Brooks turned state's witness Dudley and Stephens went to trial. They didn't\ndispute the facts they claimed they had acted out of necessity that was their defense they argued in effect better that one should die so that three could survive the prosecutor wasn't swayed by that argument he said murder is murder and so the case went to trial. Now imagine\nyou are the jury and just to simplify the discussion put aside the question of law, and let's assume that you as the jury are charged with deciding whether what they did was morally permissible or not. How many would vote not guilty, that what they did was morally\npermissible? And how many would vote guilty what they did was morally wrong? A pretty sizable majority."}, {"content": "Now let's see what people's reasons are, and let me\nbegin with those who are in the minority. Let's hear first from the defense of Dudley and Stephens. Why would you morally exonerate them? What are your reasons? I think it's I think it is morally reprehensible but I think that there's a distinction between\nwhat's morally reprehensible what makes someone legally accountable in other words the night as the judge said\nwhat's  always moral isn't necessarily against the law and while I don't think that\nnecessity justifies theft or murder any illegal act,  at some point your degree of necessity does\nin fact exonerate you form any guilt. ok. other defenders, other voices for the defense? Moral justifications for what they did? yes, thank you I just feel like  in a situation that desperate you have to do\nwhat you have to do to survive. You have to do what you have to do ya, you gotta do what you gotta do, pretty much. If you've been going nineteen days without any food you know someone just has to take the sacrifice\nhas to make sacrifices and people can survive and furthermore from that let's say they survived and then they become productive\nmembers of society who go home and then start like a million charity organizations and this and that and this and that,\nI mean they benefit everybody in the end so I mean I don't know what they did afterwards, I mean\nthey might have gone on and killed more people but whatever. what? what if they were going home and turned out to be assassins? What if they were going home and turned out to be assassins? You would want to know who they assassinated. That's true too, that's fair I would wanna know who they assassinated. alright that's good, what's your name?"}, {"content": "Marcus. We've heard a defense a couple voices for the defense now we need to hear from the prosecution most people think what they did was wrong, why? One of the first things that I was thinking was, oh well if they  \nhaven't been eating for a really long time,  maybe then they're mentally affected that could be used for the defense,  a possible argument that oh, that they weren't in a proper state of mind, they were making decisions that they otherwise wouldn't be making, and if that's an  \nappealing argument that you have to be in an altered mindset to do something\nlike that it suggests that people who find that argument convincing do you think that they're acting immorally. But I want to know what you think you're defending you k\n0:37:41.249,0:37:45.549\nyou voted to convict right? yeah\n I don't think that they acted in morally  appropriate way. And why not? What do you say,\nHere's Marcus he just defended them, he said, you heard what he said, yes I did yes that you've got to do what you've got to do in a\ncase like that. What do you say to Marcus? They didn't, that there is no situation that would allow human\nbeings to take  the idea of fate or the other people's\nlives into their own hands that we don't have that kind of power. Good, okay thanks you, and what's your name?"}, {"content": "Britt? okay. who else? What do you say? Stand up I'm wondering if Dudley and Stephens had asked for Richard Parker's  \nconsent in, you know, dying,  if that would would that exonerate them from an act of murder, and if so is that still morally\njustifiable? That's interesting, alright consent, now hang on, what's your name? Kathleen."}, {"content": "Kathleen says suppose so what would that scenario look like? so in the story Dudley is there, pen knife in hand, but instead of the prayer or before the prayer, he says, Parker, would you mind we're desperately hungry, as Marcus empathizes with we're desperately hungry you're not going to last long anyhow, you can be a martyr, would you be a martyr how about it Parker? Then, then then what do you think, would\nbe morally justified then? Suppose Parker in his semi-stupor  says okay  I don't think it'll be morally justifiable but I'm wondering. Even then, even then it wouldn't be? No You don't think that even with consent it would be morally justified. Are there people who think who want to take up Kathleen's  consent idea and who think that that would make it\nmorally justified? Raise your hand if it would if you think it would. That's very interesting Why would consent  make a moral difference? Why would it? Well I just think that if he was making his own original\nidea and it was his idea to start with then that would be the only situation in which I\nwould see it being appropriate in anyway\n \n0:40:25.940,0:40:28.359\nbecause that way you couldn't make the argument\nthat he was pressured you know it\u2019s three to one or whatever the ratio was, and I think that if he was making a decision to give his life\nthen he took on the agency to sacrifice himself which some \npeople might see as admirable and other people  might disagree with that decision. So if he came up with the idea that's the only kind of consent we could have\nconfidence in morally, then it would be okay otherwise it would be kind of coerced consent under the circumstances you think. Is there anyone who thinks that the even the consent of Parker would not justify their killing him? Who thinks that? Yes, tell us why, stand up I think that Parker would be killed with the hope that the other crew members\nwould be rescued so there's no definite reason that he should\nbe killed because you don't know  when they're going to get rescued so if you kill him you're killing him  \nin vain do you keep killing a crew member until you're rescued and then you're  \nleft with no one? because someone's going to die eventually? Well the moral logic of the situation seems to\nbe that. That they would keep on picking off the weakest maybe, one by\none, until they were rescued and in this case luckily when three at least were still alive. Now if if Parker did give his consent would it be all right do you think or not? No, it still wouldn't be right."}, {"content": "Tell us why wouldn't be all right. First of all, cannibalism, I believe is morally incorrect so you shouldn\u2019t be eating a human anyway. So cannibalism is morally objectionable outside so then even in the scenario of waiting until someone died still it would be objectionable. Yes, to me personally I feel like of it all depends on one's personal morals, like we can't just, like this is just my opinion of course other people are going to disagree. Well let's see, let's hear what their disagreements\nare and then we'll see if they have reasons that can persuade you or not. Let's try that Let's now is there someone who can explain, those of you who are tempted\nby consent can you explain why consent makes such a moral difference, what about the lottery idea does that count as consent. Remember at\nthe beginning Dudley proposed a lottery suppose that they had agreed to a lottery then how many would then say it was all right. Say there was a lottery, cabin boy lost, and the rest of the story unfolded. How\nmany people would say it's morally permissible? So the numbers are rising if we add a lottery,\nlet's hear from one of you for whom the lottery would make a moral difference why would it? I think the essential element, in my mind that makes it a crime is the idea that they decided at some point that\ntheir lives were more important than his, and that I mean that's kind of the basis for really\nany crime right? It's like my needs, my desire is a more important than yours\nand mine take precedent and if they had done a lottery were everyone\nconsented that someone should die and it's sort of like they're all sacrificing \nthemselves, to save the rest, Then it would be all right? A little grotesque but, But morally permissible? Yes."}, {"content": "what's your name?"}, {"content": "Matt. so, Matt for you what bothers you is not the cannibalism, but the lack of due process. I guess you could say that And can someone who agrees with Matt say a little bit more about why  a lottery would make it, in your view, morally permissible. The way I understood it originally was that that was the\nwhole issue is that the cabin boy was never consulted about whether or not it something was going\nto happen to him even though with the original lottery whether or not he would be a part of that\nit was just decided that he was the one that was going to die. Yes that's what happened in the actual case but if there were a lottery and they all agreed\nto the procedure you think that would be okay? Right, because everyone knows that there's gonna be\na death whereas you know the cabin boy didn't know that this discussion was even happening there was no you know forewarning for him to know that hey, I may be the one\nthat's dying. Okay, now suppose the everyone agrees to the lottery they have the lottery the cabin\nboy loses any changes his mind. You've already decided, it's like a verbal contract, you can't go back  \non that. You've decided the decision was made you know if you know you're dying for the \n reason for at others to live, you would, you know if the someone else had died you know that you would consume them, so But then he could say I know, but I lost. I just think that that's the whole moral issue is that there was\nno consulting of the cabin boy and that that's what makes it the most horrible is that he had no idea what was even\ngoing on, that if he had known what was going on it would be a bit more understandable. Alright, good, now I want to hear so there's some who think it's morally permissible but only about twenty percent, led by Marcus, then there are some who say the real problem here is the lack of consent whether the lack of consent to a lottery to\na fair procedure or Kathleen's idea, lack of consent at the moment of death and if we add consent then more people are willing to consider the sacrifice morally justified. I want to hear now finally from those of you who think even with consent even with a lottery even with a final  murmur of consent from Parker at the very last moment it would still be wrong and why would it be wrong that's what I want to hear. well the whole time I've been leaning towards the categorical moral reasoning and I think that there's a possibility I'd be okay with the\nidea of the lottery and then loser taking into their own hands to kill themselves so there wouldn't be an act of murder but\nI still think that even that way it's coerced and also I don't\nthink that there's any remorse like in Dudley's diary we're getting our breakfast it seems as though he's just sort of like, oh, you know that whole idea of not valuing someone else's life so that makes me feel like I have to take the categorical stance. You want to throw the  \nbook at him. when he lacks remorse or a sense of having done\nanything wrong. Right. Alright, good so are there any other defenders who who say it's just categorically wrong, with or without consent, yes  \nstand up. Why? I think undoubtedly the way our society is shaped, murder\nis murder murder is murder and every way our society looks down at it in the same  \nlight and I don't think it's any different in any case. Good now let \nme ask you a question, there were three lives at stake versus one, the one, that the cabin boy, he  had no family he had no dependents, these other three had families back home\nin England they had dependents they had wives and children think back to Bentham, Bentham says we have to consider the welfare, the utility, the happiness of everybody. We have to add it all up so it's not just numbers three against one it's also all of those people at home in fact the London newspaper at the time and popular opinion sympathized with them Dudley in Stephens and the paper said if they weren't motivated by affection and concern for their loved ones at\nhome and dependents, surely they wouldn't have done this. Yeah, and how is that any different from people on the corner trying to having the same desire to feed their family,\nI don't think it's any different. I think in any case if I'm murdering you to advance my status, that's murder and I think  \nthat we should look at all of that in the same light. Instead of criminalizing certain activities and making certain things seem more\nviolent and savage when in that same case it's all the same act and mentality  that goes into the murder, a necessity\nto feed their families. Suppose there weren't three, supposed there were thirty, three hundred, one life to save three hundred or in more time, three thousand or suppose the stakes were even bigger."}, {"content": "Suppose the stakes were even bigger I think it's still the same deal. Do you think Bentham was wrong to say the right thing\nto do is to add up the collected happiness, you think he's\nwrong about that? I don't think he is wrong, but I think murder is murder in any case. Well then Bentham has to be wrong if you're right he's wrong. okay then he's wrong. Alright thank you, well done. Alright, let's step back from this discussion and notice how many objections have we heard to what they did. we heard some defenses of what they did the defense has had to do with  necessity the dire circumstance and, implicitly at least, the idea that numbers matter and not only numbers matter but the wider effects matter their families back home, their dependents Parker was an orphan, no one would miss him. so if you add up if you tried to calculate the balance of happiness and suffering you might have a case for  saying what they did was the right thing then we heard at least three different types\nof objections, we heard an objection that's said what they did was categorically wrong, right here at the end categorically wrong. Murder is murder it's always wrong even if it increases the overall happiness of society the categorical objection. But we still need to investigate why murder is categorically wrong. Is it because even cabin boys have certain fundamental rights? And if that's the reason where do those rights come from if not from\nsome idea of the larger welfare or utility or happiness? Question number one. Others said a lottery would make a difference a fair procedure, Matt said. And some people were swayed by that. That's not a categorical objection exactly it's saying everybody has to be counted as an equal even though, at the end of the day one can be sacrificed for the general welfare. That leaves us with another question to investigate, Why does agreement to certain procedure,  even a fair procedure, justify whatever result flows from the operation of that procedure? Question number two. and question number three the basic idea of consent. Kathleen got us on to this. If the cabin boy had agreed himself and not under duress as was added then it would be all right to take his life \nto save the rest. Even more people signed on to that idea but that raises a third philosophical question what is the moral work that consent does? Why does an act of consent make such a moral difference that an act that would be wrong, taking a life,\nwithout consent is morally permissible with consent? To investigate those three questions we're going to have to read some philosophers and starting next time we're going to read Bentham, and John Stuart Mill, utilitarian philosophers.

It's really nice of you to come tonight. My name is Melissa Franklin. I'm a physicist. You can clap now. I'm really excited about this talk tonight. I just want to say that I invited Professor Eskies to give this talk before the election. So obviously I'm brilliant. And I'm so happy that she's giving this talk tonight because it's so important, so incredibly important. This topic, the scientist, is sentinel is probably the most important thing for a lot of us right now. What do we do now? How do we make a contribution? So Naomi Eskies is kind of an interesting person. I've known her for just a little while because she arrived at Harvard just a few years ago as a professor in the history of science department. And in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department. And she's very cool. But most cool is that she got her degree from the School of Mines. I love School of Mines at the Imperial College in England, the place where there is now Brexit. And she left early and came back and went to Stanford University to do her PhD. But she didn't want to just do a normal PhD. She had to make it up herself because it's not in just one department, which I also like. So I just like her a lot in many ways. But maybe possibly other than the incredible work she does right now, which is so important to us, is her work with the Pope. Sorry, I know that sounds funny. But she wrote an introduction to the encyclical on climate change and inequality with Pope Francis. I've never really worked with the Pope. But I hear he's a great guy. And I wish he'd asked me, and even though I don't know anything about anything really, about climate change. Also, she's just incredibly prolific. She wrote a book called 2014 called The Collapse of Western Civilization, which was a positive thing. And she's also given really good TED talks, if you like that kind of thing. And she's just an incredible historian, but also she knows science. And she also wrote some books that I don't even know. The words about, like, do we believe in climate change?"}, {"content": "That's really important. So sorry, I think the thing that I'm looking forward to tonight is hearing from a really sane person who's very creative. And she's going to tell us what to do. She's going to tell us what to do. So please welcome her. Well, thank you for that great introduction. One of the things I've always struggled with as a historian and philosopher of science, who studies science and thinks about what scientists should do, is in my experience, most scientists do not want historians to tell them what to do. So I'm really, really happy that we've come to this moment. It's not turned on. I thought I'd turn it on. Okay, we've come to this moment where a physicist wants me to tell her what to do. That's pretty special."}, {"content": "I also thank you for that generous introduction. When I was studying at the Royal School of Mines, which is part of Imperial College London, and people would ask me where I went to school, and I would say go to the Royal School of Mines, and they would say, the Royal School of Mines? Are you studying philosophy? So yes, the Royal School of Mines, I studied mining geology. Also, when you said I'm very interesting, my mother is the kindest, sweetest person on earth, and never, ever, ever likes to say anything bad about anyone. But if you put on an article of clothing, the she thinks is a little not so flattering, she'll say, oh, that's interesting. So my family being interesting is not necessarily a compliment, but I will take it as a compliment here tonight. What I want to talk to you tonight about is work I've actually been doing for a number of years about this question of what the role of scientists should really be in relation to talking about contested public policy issues. I developed this specific talk for AAAAS that was here in Boston last month. I had the honor to do a keynote speech talk there. So I developed this talk as a talk about science for scientists. So in this talk, I'm going to use the word we when I refer to scientists. For those of you who aren't scientists, you can just say they, but the message I think is relevant for all of us in thinking through what our role needs to be in terms of thinking about contested issues of public policy. So some of you may have, and I'm going to come out from behind this podium because I don't like podiums. I don't like to be separated from my people. So some of you may have seen this that ran in the New Yorker a few weeks ago. Those smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us. Who thinks I should fly the plane? Now of course we all laugh at that because to us it's obvious that the public ignores expertise and it's peril. And as people associated with a great university like Harvard, we have an expectation that our expertise should be respected and in many cases acted on. But as we've seen of late, many of our political leaders not only don't act on our expertise, but they actually rejected. And in some cases they actively misrepresented. And that creates a very difficult situation for us. What should we do when our work, our expertise, is being rejected, dispatched, and in some cases misrepresented? Should we speak up in public? Should we be speaking up in public on tricky, sensitive topics like evolution or the safety of vaccinations or in my case climate change? And if so, how? And what exactly does it mean to say that we should respect expertise? What are the boundaries of expertise? And if we as experts embrace a public role, what does that entail? So I want to start by talking about a scientist that I've studied in some detail, a man by the name of Roger Revelle. How many of you have heard of Revelle before? Oh a lot."}, {"content": "Wow, this is a great audience."}, {"content": "And not just the Earth Science professors. So Revelle, as many of you know, is a very famous chemical oceanographer. He was also one of the directors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. And he was also the mentor to Al Gore. It's because of Roger Revelle that Al Gore first learned about climate change and began to think of it as a serious issue. In 1965, Revelle was serving as part of the President's Science Advisory Committee, a group that was writing a report on the state of the environment. And this report had an appendix that was co-author with four of his prominent geoscientific colleagues, including Dave Killing. And the title of this appendix was atmospheric CO2, the invisible pollutant. And in this appendix, Revelle and his colleagues warned that in due course, not tomorrow, not next year, but in due course, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide would likely alter the climate in serious and adverse ways. They wrote, throughout his worldwide industrial civilization, men is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment. By the year 2000, the increase in atmospheric CO2 will be close to 25%. This may be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps market changes in climate. And as we all know today now, that prediction came true. So we can say that these leading scientists of a previous generation were acting as sentinels. They were calling attention to an issue that was not yet publicly recognized, in fact not even recognized by most of their scientific colleagues at this time. And they were pointing out that while the issue of visible pollution was getting a lot of attention in the media and in halls of power, particularly smog and Los Angeles, or the terrible London fogs that had killed people in the 1950s, there were other invisible pollutants that were also important. And carbon dioxide was probably the most important of these invisible pollutants. So they reached out to political leaders, in this case to the president of the United States, about their scientific research that implied a societal threat. Now, in our research and the Revell archives, we've never found any evidence that Revell worried that this might somehow not be an appropriate thing to do. On the contrary, in the context of growing public concern about air pollution in the 1960s, Revell considered to be obviously appropriate to alert political leaders to this other form of pollution that was not as obvious but could also have serious long term effects. And we also have seen from our research that most of the political leaders to whom he reached out did seem to be at least cautiously receptive to being made aware of this issue. And in current research that I'm doing here with two of my graduate students here at Harvard in the history of science department, Hannah Conway and Colleen Linear-Kristenson, we've identified a number of political leaders in the 1960s who took an interest in this issue and who thanked Revell and his colleagues for sending these materials to them. In some cases, followed up and asked for more information."}, {"content": "So those were, it was a very different time. Now, today though, many of us are reluctant to be sentinels. Many of us are worried that if we speak up in public beyond the confines of scientific publications or scientific meetings and conferences, that this will lead to us being viewed as advocates or activists, and that we will politicize our science and will lose credibility. So, I think that if you have heard this in last few weeks, maybe some of you have been involved in conversations with your students or your colleagues here at Harvard about whether we should participate in the March for Science and whether or not that threatens to politicize science in an undesirable way. So this is a question that colleagues and I have been looking at actually for a few years. Well, before the March on Science or March for Science or whatever March on Science, no. Guess it's a March for Science Donald Trump is marching on science. Well, before the current political situation, my colleagues and I have been interested in this question of how scientists think about their role in relation to political questions. So I've been for several years now part of a project that's coming wrapping up now called assessing assessments. My colleagues on this are Dale Jamison who just talked at the law school today about other work and Michael Oppenheimer and several other postdocs and graduate students. So in our work, this was one of the things that we asked scientists about. We asked them how do you think about the relationship between science and policy and how do you think about your role in relation to that question. And what we found was a very consistent pattern where the vast majority of scientists that we asked expressed a great deal of reluctance to take on any role other than simply presenting factual information in the context of scientific assessments. So not expressing opinions on policy and not even presenting those facts in other contexts outside of the assessment framework. And when we probe this and ask why many expressed the idea that there is or needs to be a bright line between science and the one hand and policy on the other. And that speaking up in public, even about the facts threatens to dull that line. And therefore scientists said, scientists said things like, well, you should do your work, but you should not go public. Some said using imperative, you must not go public. You must not cross the line. And when we said, well, why?"}, {"content": "They said, well, because if you do, you'll lose your credibility. The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has addressed this issue explicitly through its rubric of being policy relevant, but not policy prescriptive. IPCC leaders acknowledge that their work is not pure science. That climate science is linked to major public policy issues. And that the IPCC exists because of its link to governance through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But nevertheless, even though they acknowledge that the IPCC itself is a kind of hybrid organization, most climate scientists working within the IPCC still say that they should refrain from taking any kind of public policy. And they say, well, they should not be taking any kind of public role and stay removed from discussion of policy implications and considerations. And one of the most common refrains that we've heard both in the context of this research and more broadly is scientists saying that we should let the facts speak for themselves. The climate science colleague, James Hanson, has also written about this issue, and he's referred to this as redisense. He said that scientists in general are reluctant to speak up about what they know about climate change, so not just about the policy things, but even to speak up in public about the facts. And again, because they believe that we need to let the facts speak for themselves. Now, those of you who saw the poster for this talk saw that one of the pictures on it is this picture of Jim Hanson getting arrested, protesting at the White House over the lack of action on climate change. Many scientists who have we have spoken to have invoked Jim Hanson as proof. Now, Hanson has become a major figure not only because he speaks up about the evidence of climate change, which he does, but also because he's become an advocate for particular solutions. So he is an advocate for a carbon price established through a fee and dividend system. And in support of this work, he has been arrested several times. But I want to ask the question tonight, what exactly is Hanson proof of other than maybe that scientists are uncomfortable with his position? And it's not just climate science. This is an issue that affects scientists in many, many areas. So people who work in re-biology and conservation, people who study lead or other toxic in the environment, endocrine disrupting chemicals, neo-nicotonoid pesticides, and their potential impacts on pollinators, genetically modified crops, vaccine safety, the harms of sugar in the American diet, deaths and injury from gun violence, all of these are issues on which scientists do scientific work collect data factual information, but they have policy implications, policy implications that may be highly contested. So scientists in many fields face this sentinel problem. And I want to argue that scientists in the past have faced this problem too. That although this moment we're living in may feel unique, it certainly feels distinctive and troubling in our lifetimes, but it isn't actually a unique moment in terms of scientists facing this question of what their roles should be. So we could think of this problem as having a kind of spectrum of choices. At one end we might say, as many scientists do say, that we should just do our science and leave it to others to communicate it, to explain why it matters, and we're needed to propose remedies. And we could call this the pure science ideal. At the other end we could think about Jim Hanson, who does speak out, does get involved, does propose remedies, and in his case does even get arrested, we could call that the activist ideal. So what I want to do tonight is to argue for a middle ground. Now as a person who works on climate change, I adamantly reject the idea that the truth is always in the middle, because it's often not, but tonight I do want to suggest that there is a kind of middle ground that we might think about occupying. And then in any case thinking about the spectrum helps us think about where we want to be on that spectrum, because at the end of the day there isn't actually a right or wrong answer to this. These are judgments, but historical experience, historical evidence can help us make those judgments. Oh, thank you very much, and help us judge where we want to be in relation to this question. So my argument tonight has three parts. The first is to talk about historical precedent. To look at an example of scientists in the past who did step up and act as sentinels, not just on the fact of the problem, but also on policy solutions, and to argue that this precedent refutes our worry or our anxiety that taking a public position on an urgent issue undermines the credibility of our science, and then to argue to conclude that I do believe we need to speak because facts don't in fact speak for themselves. So what is the historical precedent? Well, some of you may already know, maybe you've heard me talk before, but it's obviously it's the precedent of nuclear weaponry. Many climate scientists feel that we are today in an existential crisis. Scientists in 1945 knew that they were. There was no question among physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, who worked on nuclear weapons, that the potential for an arms race meant the potential to eliminate life on Earth as we knew it. And in this context, particularly as 1945 became 1948 and the Soviet Union exploded its first hydrogen bomb, and then the, sorry, it's atomic bomb, and then the United States developed a hydrogen bomb, and then the Soviet Union developed a hydrogen bomb, and pretty soon we were in an arms race. Many leading physicists felt that they had a moral obligation to speak out against nuclear proliferation. As many of you know, they had played an essential role in creating these weapons, and these weapons now threatened human safety and potentially even human survival. And therefore they felt it was actually rather obvious that they had an obligation to raise an alarm and suggest means to control this threat. So, drawing on the framework of scientific rationality, they argued that it was rational to be alarmed and irrational to be complacent. And therefore they did have an obligation. But one of the interesting things about this discussion that takes place in the late 40s and 50s is that many of these physicists argue that their obligation is not just to speak up on the technical aspects of nuclear weaponry, to explain how they worked and how they killed people and why they were so damaging, but also to address the problem of what to do about them, about how to control them. Because to them it was eminently clear that these things did need to be controlled. There was no real plausible argument that an unrestricted arms race would be a good thing for the world. The most famous example as many of you know is Niels Bohr, who spoke out actually even before the end of World War II, and predicted the arms race that would follow if there were not some kind of international dream in between the US and the Soviet Union. And also Albert Einstein, who in later years famously became an advocate for international peace and arms control. But it wasn't just Bohr and Einstein. Sometimes people have said to me, well Bohr could afford it, he was so famous or Einstein could afford to speak out. But it wasn't just these incredibly conspicuously famous figures. Actually a wide range of physicists, Hans Betta, Leo Zalard, James Frong, Philip Morrison, who taught for many years in MIT, and many, many others. There are dozens of physicists that we could name who became involved in a variety of different ways, large and small, to help alert the world to the threat of nuclear weapons and engage people in a conversation about arms control and disarmament. These men spoke to the moral imperative to control nuclear weapons, and they became advocates. The core of their argument is something that I've labeled epistemic proximity. And I think it's an important argument to understand because it's not just about a kind of moral obligation that arose from having built the weapons, but it also has specifically to do with their role as they understand it as experts. So the argument goes like this. not just that they helped build these weapons, but it's that as physicists, they had a uniquely vivid appreciation and understanding of the damage that these weapons could wreak. That they could explain things that other people really didn't and maybe even couldn't fully understand about what an arms race and a large-scale nuclear exchange would really mean. So people had seen the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. John Hersey had written about it very beautifully in his book Hiroshima, but many people said, well, yes, it's true, lots of people died, but how is that worse or different than the fire bombing in Dresden or the fire bombing of Tokyo? So for many people, it wasn't actually clear why these weapons were substantially worse. Now, this seems hard to conceptualize today and previously the slide said today, all the world leaders understand what a major nuclear explain would do. Okay, well, when you do contemporary history, you have to stand your toes. But clearly, in the late 40s and 50s, that was not the case. Some of you may know that President Harry Truman when confronted with the announcement of the Soviet atomic bomb and when he was asked, well, does this mean there will be an arms race, he said yes, and we will win it. Douglas MacArthur during the Korean conflict requested permission to use nuclear weapons. So it's not the case that people understood that using nuclear weapons would necessarily lead to some kind of terrible conflagration. So these scientists felt that the need to understand fully and viscerally what a large-scale nuclear exchange would mean that this need was severe and that they had to step up to that challenge and many of them did so in both public and private ways. So I think a comparable argument can be made about climate change today. I've given something like 300 public talks on climate change and I've spoken, I'm going to South Dakota tomorrow, so I now will have been to 47 or 50 states and I've talked in Idaho and North Dakota and Texas and Oklahoma and California. And one of the things that I feel I've learned is that many people, including many people who do not deny climate change or do not disparage climate science, still don't really quite get why this issue really matters. They don't quite understand just how serious uncontrolled climate change will be. One of my colleagues, quite famous and distinguished political scientists, said to me once over lunch, so tell me why I should be worried about polar bears. And this is part of why Eric Conway and I wrote the collapse of Western civilization because we were trying to think about, what could we do, what kind of story could we tell that would convey to people why climate change really matters and why this is not just a question of polar bears as much as I personally do love and worry about polar bears. Okay, so part two, I want to argue that this historical press and offers evidence that refutes our worry that taking a public position on an urgent issue will undermine our scientific credibility. And this argument is actually extremely short. The evidence simply doesn't support this hypothesis. If we think about Albert Einstein, I know of no evidence and maybe someone can come up with it but I know of no evidence that the theory of relativity or his work on the photoelectric effect ever lost credibility because of his advocacy of arms control. Now, there were anti-Semites in Germany who didn't like Einstein, but that was not because of his public advocacy. That was because of a whole set of other complicated issues. Hans Betta, as many of you know, won the Nobel Prize for his work on nuclear fusion fusion. No one ever suggested revoking that prize or that somehow that work was doubted or dubious because he was an arms control advocate. And Bohr is such an interesting character. Some of you know, many of Bohr's colleagues were dubious about the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Bohr wrote a lot of philosophical essays that lots of his colleagues thought were completely off the rails. But it wasn't, but not his arms control advocacy. Millions of schoolchildren learned about the Bohr model of the atom. If you took high school physics or college physics, you learned about the liquid drop model of fish and you learned about his crucial scientific contributions. And no one ever said that those contributions were undermined because he advocated arms control. Now what about Robert Oppenheimer? Some people say to me, well, what about Oppenheimer? Oppenheimer is a famous case of a scientist who got discredited. But what exactly happened to Oppenheimer? He lost his security clearance because of his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. And also because Edward Teller held a personal grudge against him. And he saw this as an opportunity to undermine him. So Oppenheimer lost political standing inside the US government. He lost his clearance. He lost his capacity to give advice to political leaders on certain delicate issues. But losing political standing with politicians is a very different thing than losing scientific credibility. And in fact, Oppenheimer became a hero in many circles. I mean, many of you have heard of Oppenheimer because of this, more than because of his science. So among many people, he gained credibility. So when we talk about credibility, we actually have to be more precise. We have to ask, are we talking about credibility with political leaders? Are we talking about credibility with the public? Are we talking about credibility with our own colleagues? Or what?"}, {"content": "These are different things. There's no evidence that Oppenheimer lost scientific credibility with any of his colleagues because of this work. So I want to argue that the fear of losing scientific credibility is exactly that. It's a fear. It's an anxiety. And there's actually very little evidence to support the worry. And you can call me naive, but I do think we should be making our decisions based on evidence. Even though I know that's a very controversial claim to make in the stage. And some of you may have seen that there's actually a study that just came out a couple weeks ago."}, {"content": "And I apologize I haven't had a time to make a slide of it. But a recent study that actually interviewed people of the public and posed to them some scenarios where scientists spoke out in public, made policy recommendations, actually showed that there's very little evidence to suggest that this causes you to lose credibility with the public either. So it's actually an interesting question. And it will be a question for another talk about, actually, why we are so worried about this issue when there's actually so little evidence to support it. But I haven't done that work to answer that question yet. OK, so part three, facts don't speak for themselves. Well, why do I say that? Why don't facts speak for themselves? Well, the simple answer. And when I started saying this 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago, this was considered controversial. Now it seems obvious. So that's good. I can make the talk shorter. We live in a world where many people are trying to silence facts. And as you know, as many of us now understand, these arguments are not actually about the facts. They're not just about the facts. In most cases, they're not even actually about the facts at all. Many of the arguments that are being used to undermine climate science, to be able to undermine evolution, to undermine vaccine safety. These are arguments about political beliefs, about economic interests, and about values. You cannot refute a claim about values with facts, or claim about facts with values. That's what philosophers would call a category mistake. We're conflating two different domains. If people are rejecting climate science because of values, then we have to think about what those values are, and why those values are perceived to be in conflict with our facts. And this was essentially the conclusion of the work I did with my colleague Eric Conway when we wrote the book Merchants of Doub."}, {"content": "When we started this project, we were frankly mystified. We had come across a story of some very famous scientists that we actually knew, one of whom had been the director of the script's institution of oceanography, where I was working at the time. And these prominent distinguished famous scientists had become climate change deniers. And there was no possibility that this was scientific illiteracy, because these were some of the most brilliant and successful scientists of the 20th century. It included Frederick Sites, who was the president of the US National Academy of Sciences. So the question we had was, why would these people reject the scientific work of their own colleagues? How do you make sense of that? And what we found overwhelmingly, not just are these men that we studied in our book, but in general that the rejection of climate scientific facts was not about scientific illiteracy or lack of scientific understanding. But actually, it was driven by an anxiety, by fear, by a worry, the worry that addressing climate change would lead to bigger government, higher taxes, and loss of personal freedom. And those concerns and the solutions that people were proposing for climate science were seen as clustering with conservative values. And that's why we've seen this enormous politicization of the issue because of conservatives believing that the implications of climate science threaten their values. It's this clash of values, then, that explains the polarization, and also some of the otherwise strange alliances that we see on this issue. The perception that addressing climate change, sorry, that addressing climate change will require big government or higher taxes, explains a good deal of the political polarization around the issue because opponents of big government are ideologically motivated to reject climate scientific events. And they've made common cause, then, with industries that reject the science because it threatens their profit. So the obvious part of this story, the economic mode of this economic self-interest aligns with a more subtle and complicated story about people seeing climate science as clashing with and threatening their values. So just to sum this up, I want to show you a short clip from the film that we were made of our movie. And this is just kind of merchants of doubt. And in that shell, it shows you who these people are and the sorts of arguments that they make to try to undermine scientific findings. Bill O'Keefe is Executive Vice President of the American Petroleum Institute. He's also a board member of the Global Climate Coalition, made up of oil and electric companies, automakers, and others. We believe it was the war on the oil. They had an off-hoyle agenda. Climate change was part of that. I think that it's unfortunate that the science is so distorted and mistated. And without it... The science is complicated. There are lots of different factors. So you really have to understand the whole picture. There is a natural variability that has nothing to do with me. Climate is changing naturally. Has to do with sunspots and has to do with the wobble of the earth. And so it's not too difficult to persuade some of the public that we really don't know for sure. So maybe that's way to wild. We need to have more proof. We need more data. The science isn't there to make that determination. There is no need for us to rush to this kind of judgment to respond. Others put out ads saying more pollution is going to be good for us. A doubling of the CO2 content to the atmosphere will produce a tremendous greening of planet Earth. CO2 is a benefit to plant life. It's increasing the bounty and the productivity of the planet, our ability to feed populations in this world. What you're seeing here from the coal industry is perfectly analogous to what the tobacco industry is to do. They refuse to change, refuse to shift. And they're trying to convince us that it's actually good for us, the way they used to say, luckies make you healthy. OK, so in that clip, you see sort of the basic, you see the merchants have doubt doing their thing. But in that clip, you're seeing people, mostly who represent the fossil fuel industry. So Lee Raymond from Exxon Mobil, Don Blankenship from Massey, Energy, Bill O'Kee from the American Petroleum Institute. But again, as I already mentioned, part of what we were trying to do in our work was to understand why would scientists, why would other people who don't have stock and exome mobile, why would they make common cause with this sort of work? And again, as I've already suggested, it's this confluence of money and ideology that explains the pattern that we saw. And this also helps to explain why climate change now is so much more prevalent in the United States than elsewhere. Because of our powerful commitment to individualism in the United States, and the historic American skepticism about the federal government going back to the founding of the Republican skepticism about centralized decision making. And if you think about it, think about the articles of confederation, think about the separation of powers. This country was rooted in an idea that investing too much power in centralized government would undermine the individual freedoms of the states and the people in them. We have a deeply rooted belief in the United States that the government that governs best governs least. And that's a belief that informs a huge amount of climate change denial. So climate skeptics, contrairions, deniers, whatever you want to call them, they play on these cultural norms, insisting that addressing climate change will lead to an expansion of the government and a constriction of our freedoms. And you've seen this kind of ideology on display in the last few weeks. And this resonates very strongly with many ordinary Americans, particularly in what we've come to call the red states. And therefore, people resist accepting the findings of climate science, and they're open to the suggestion that our findings are exaggerated or even perhaps a hoax. So I want to just give one example of how this works in sort of one scientist that we study that I think is a particularly illustrative example of how this ideological piece comes together with rejecting the findings of science. So one of the people that we studied was a physicist named Fred Singer, who some of you may be are familiar with. Singer was not a climate scientist. He was a physicist. In fact, he was the proverbial rocket scientist. He was the first director of the US whether satellite service and was involved in the early years of the US rocketry and space programs. But in addition to his scientific work, he was also involved in campaigns to challenge the scientific evidence of acid rain, of the ozone hole, of climate change, and also of the harms of tobacco. Fred Singer, in the early 1990s, worked with the Philip Morris tobacco company to attack the US Environmental Protection Agency over the issue of secondhand smoke. Now some of you know that we have known since the 1980s that secondhand smoke can cause cancer. The same chemicals that are in primary smoke also occur in the exiled smoke or in smoke that comes from a cigarette that's just burning. And if you breathe that smoke, you also can be subject to cancer and many of the other diseases that affect smoking, smokeers. This was first stated unequivocally in 1986 in a report of the US surgeon general in which the surgeon general declared that involuntary smoking, that was the term he used, is a cause of disease including lung cancer and healthy non-smokers, especially children. And based on this, as well as an independent review of over 6,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers, in the early 1990s, the EPA declared secondhand smoke to be a class A or proven carcinogen. In 1994, working with the tobacco industry, Fred Singer wrote a report attacking these scientific findings. And one of the reasons, this is a copy of out of the tobacco legacy documents of the cover page for this report. And I made this slide because Fred Singer is still alive and he accused me of being a liar. He has said in public that he never worked with the tobacco industry. So, yeah, there it is. Okay, so I love documents."}, {"content": "I love my job. So, Singer had been working as a consultant to Philip Morris and he was hooked up, I'm not sure exactly how, but he became, he started working with a lawyer named Kent Jeffries, a lawyer who was affiliated with the Kato Institute and the competitive enterprise institute. And some of you know these are things that promote free market solutions to social policy problems. The report was actually published by the Alexis de Toekeville Institute but funded by the tobacco institute, which was the so-called research arm of the tobacco industry. So, this report illustrates in a nutshell how this works. There's a kind of shell game where the tobacco industry would give money to the tobacco institute claiming that that was for research. Tobacco Institute would hire lawyers out of thing tanks like the Kato Institute. They would then work with a scientist who would give the thing scientific credibility and produce a report that would be issued by yet another thing tank. In this case, the Alexis de Toekeville Institute whose name would conjure up notions of freedom and democracy in America. Now, the interest of the tobacco industry in attacking the EPA is obvious. And I think the interest of these thing tanks in opposing regulation is nearly as obvious. But why would a physicist attack the scientific evidence of the harms of tobacco? Well, I would assume that singer was paid for this work but that's not the key part of the story in my view. The key part, I think, comes from his own words. So, in the introduction to this report, he explains why it's important to push back against the EPA. And he says, quote, if we do not carefully delineate the government's role in regulating dangers, there's essentially no limit to how much government can ultimately control our lives. And in our book and in our films, we document many, many examples of this argument. If we allow the government to regulate X, then soon it will also regulate Y and Z and we will lose our freedom. Acid rain today, the Bill of Rights tomorrow. This argument comes directly from the work of the Chicago economist Milton Friedman. And it's an argument that I call the capitalism and freedom argument. And indeed, we've seen this argument being resurrected in the last few months. It was used by Ronald Reagan in the 1990s to justify lower taxation, less government and to foster a marketplace deregulation. And that set of arguments has really been guiding conservative thinking in the United States since the Reagan administration. The two key texts are Milton Friedman's book by that name, capitalism and freedom, which was inspired and turned by the work of the Austrian neoliberal economist Friedrich von Haack. So if you're interested in this problem, these are the two books that you need to read to understand the intellectual framework that is guiding this whole argument. But if you go back to von Haack, his basic argument is he's making this argument towards the end of World War II, he's saying if we allow Western democracies to have national health insurance or other forms of intervention in the marketplace, we're going to be on the road to surf dumb. And it's only a matter of time."}, {"content": "It's a kind of inevitable creeping of government controlled into different aspects of life. So this is the common thread of science denial. And in fact, the common thread between climate change, acid rain, tobacco, and other things that otherwise might seem to be totally different issues, that scientists discover a problem, typically inadvertently, I mean, the scientists who were working on acid rain didn't set out to discover acid rain. They were studying forest ecology and watershed hydrology. But scientists discover a problem. And the solution to this problem appears to require some sort of government action, whether it's putting a price on carbon or banning CFCs or limiting sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants. And so people who don't want that government action, either for economic reasons or philosophical ones, question the science and attack the scientists. Sociologists call this implacatory denial. You deny something because you don't like its implications. And it's a common pattern in human life. It's not restricted to climate change denial. But if you deny the evidence that your partner is having an affair, maybe that's OK. Life goes on. If you deny the evidence that the climate is changing, the consequences are pretty serious. So science has been politicized to bring this now back to our question. Science has been politicized as a means to undermine it by groups and individuals who do not like what they interpret to be the political implications of our scientific findings. So here's the crucial point, though. When scientists were attacked, when the scientists who worked on tobacco or acid rain or the ozone hole were attacked, it wasn't because they had crossed the line into policy. Most of the scientists who were attacked in these stories that we wrote about had actually not played any role in public policy at all. They had done what most of us think we're supposed to do. Do important work, publish and period your journals. Talk about. out of the meetings, but their scientific research had revealed or affirmed serious problems like deaths from tobacco use or the threat to life on Earth from ozone depletion. So these scientists did not become targets because they had spoken out. They became targets because of the importance and significance of their work. So I think that many of us in the scientific community have actually misinterpreted cause and effect. The causal arrow is the reverse of what most of us think. Now it is true that today there are some climate scientists like Mike Mann and like Jim Hanson who have spoken out, who have become public figures, but even these men, even Mike Mann and Jim Hanson, both of whom I know, they became public figures after they were attacked. They were scientists doing science. They got attacked and being attacked made them decide that they needed to stand up and be counted. So it may help to understand this also to know that there is actually a very long history in the United States of claiming that government intervention in the marketplace threatens our freedom. And this is from some new work I am doing now trying to understand the deeper roots of this argument, which it turns out go back to at least the 1920s. And one of the ironies of this is that these arguments have actually often been used to protect products, products, profits. And in some cases actually to restrict competition even when people are claiming to support a free market society. So I just thought this is such a very interesting advertisement that I found. And I thought I would ask you, what do you think this might be an ad for? And my postdoc is not allowed to answer, but anybody else? Yeah, Barbara wire, that is the usual answer. Sometimes people say hats. The answer is privately generated electricity. This was part of an ad campaign run in the early 1960s by a group of private sector electrical utilities who did not want the federal government to generate electricity at the Hoover Dam or other places in the United States. Now we can argue about the benefits of government electricity, but the point is to see that the argument is not being made, it's not about the merits of different ways of generating electricity. The argument is this fear mongering campaign that if we allow the government to generate electricity, pretty soon we'll be living behind barbed wire. So what does all of this tell us about facts and values? Well, we see that in all these stories, the facts and values are conflated and complicated in difficult ways that are difficult to sort out. But the key insight I think is to understand that these arguments are not about the scientific facts and because they're not about facts, they can't be refuted with facts. But they can be addressed with political or historical evidence or with other arguments about values. So for example, one thing we can do is to challenge the assertion that addressing climate change necessarily requires bigger government or higher taxes. And a good example of this is the history of acid rain. So some people in the audience here I know remember that acid rain, which was a very serious problem, was addressed in the 1990s through amendments to the Clean Air Act that created emissions trading, a market-based mechanism that was supported by both Democrats and Republicans and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. This law did not lead to the expansion of the federal government, it did not lead to higher taxes, nor did it lead to a loss of liberty of people living in the Midwest where acid rain was a problem. And in fact, the price of electricity in the American Midwest fell. The second thing I think that's important for us to think about is that I think we shouldn't be afraid to address values. For two reasons, first of all, because these are values, questions we have to address the values involved. If we just keep throwing more facts on people, it won't address the worry, the concern that they have. So if our fellow citizens in South Dakota, Ohio, or Oklahoma are worried about bigger government or worried about values, then we have to be able to talk about that. And I think that preventing disruptive climate change actually lines up with the fundamental values that many of our fellow Americans share. In fact, I think it lines up with more values that many of our fellow Americans share than simply the value of constraining big government. So think about it. The value of fairness, which includes protecting innocent people from getting hurt. We controlled secondhand smoke in part because there was so much overwhelming evidence that secondhand smoke hurt children. And that was one of the very powerful arguments that was made for the right of the EPA to regulate secondhand smoke in order to prevent hurt or harm to innocent people like non-smokers and children who were not choosing to smoke. Or the value of accountability that the people who made a problem have an obligation to address it. Or the value of being realistic, of accepting that market failures are reality, and sometimes there is the need for the government to nudge the market in the right direction. We saw that during the housing crisis we've seen it in the financial crisis. People know that markets don't always work the way we want them to. Or the value of technological leadership and hard work of rolling up our sleeves and getting the job done, something that Americans have always done and prided themselves in doing. And of course, most importantly is the argument that there are values that the market does not protect like the basic inherent dignity of all people. And this is the central argument that Pope Francis makes in the encyclical on climate change and inequality, that there is an inherent dignity to all humans, and that that is something that we all have a right to defend and protect. Freedom is important, but so are many other things. And in the long run, climate change deniers are not actually protecting our freedom. In fact, they're threatening it. And this I think is one of the most powerful arguments we can make. That while the climate change deniers say freedom, freedom, freedom, which they do, in reality, the shoe is on that other foot. So I want to just show you one other clip from the film where I'm speaking and addressing this issue. As sea level rises and hurricanes become more intense, people get killed. Their houses and communities get destroyed. But think about heat waves and droughts that ruin agricultural communities. All of these are problems that it will require government intervention to address. The great irony of the story to me is that people who don't like big government are going to get more of it. And we're going to see more money being spent on dealing with the aftermath of these disasters. There will be billions of dollars in real estate losses, but more than that, people die. That's why it matters. That's why this is meaningful for us and not just for polar bears or people in Bangladesh. That's why so many people in the scientific community now are really starting to talk in very worried tones. Because there's, I think, a growing sense in scientific community that we're running out of time to prevent a train ride. So obviously my argument is that we do need to speak up because we need to counter the disinformation, the misinformation, and the false value arguments that are being made by other people. But I want to end with one more thought which gets back to this idea of epistemic proximity. So if we go back to Roger Revelle in the 1960s, Revelle spoke up because he knew about something, the possibility of disruptive climate change that few other people were aware of. And like Born Einstein and Beta before them, Revelle and killing and their colleagues, we're speaking from their proximate expertise. Meaning about something that they understood by virtue of their expertise as scientists that other people did not understand. But they also respected the expertise of others to propose and formulate the solutions. And Revelle worked on climate change his whole life. He studied it from many different angles. But he always was very cautious about any response to a question about what the right policy solution was. And I think this points to an important distinction. And it's not the fact value distinction as people have normally understood it, but it is related to it. It's about the limits of expertise. It's about who really knows how to fly that plane. So there are many things which is natural scientists or social scientists depending on what our expertise is. There are many things which we're not experts about and not particularly qualified to speak about. So in the case of climate change, if you're a climate scientist, if you do work on the physical science of climate change, you're not particularly knowledgeable in most cases about the social and economic aspects of impacts or the details of policy. Earth scientists cannot say, oh sorry, Earth scientists can say that if we're to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system, which is what the UN Framework Convention commits us to, then we must do something to control greenhouse gases because greenhouse gases and deforestation are the causes of this problem. Just as CFCs were the causes of ozone depletion and second-hand smoke was the cause of lung cancer and otherwise healthy non-smokers. And that means preventing the continued dumping of CO2 into the atmosphere. That is a conclusion that falls directly from our science. We could call it a direct deductive consequence. And therefore I want to argue we should not hesitate to say things that fall out directly from our scientific knowledge and understanding. Indeed, I would argue that it is our responsibility to do so because we are the people who have that epistemic proximity, who understand the problem best. And in my model for this, then I said in the beginning I was going to put forward an idea of the responsible scientist and I think we have a model of someone who played that role in the United States and that's Sherry Rowling, who won the Nobel Prize in the mid-1990s for his work accurately predicting that chlorinated fluorocarbons would deplete stratospheric ozone. In the 1980s Rowling and his colleagues realized that unless we control CFCs, then destruction of stratospheric ozone would threaten the future of life on Earth. And because of that he began to speak publicly and like his nuclear physics colleagues beforehand he became an advocate for action to control these chemicals that were the cause of ozone depletion. So for him policy was a deductive consequence. Rowling felt that he couldn't do this because the need to control CFCs was a direct consequence of the scientific work. So we can think of the argument as going like this, CFCs destroyed ozone. stratospheric ozone protects life on Earth. So if we want to protect life on Earth, if we want life to continue, we must somehow control CFCs. Now, this didn't involve an implicit value premise, but that value premise was the value of life on Earth. And really, who was going to challenge that? I mean, that's a debate that I'd be happy to take on with any climate change denier. But here's the important point. His advocacy didn't undermine his scientific credibility. He did his key work in the 70s and early 80s and he became an advocate for action in the middle to later 80s and played a role actually in the development of the Montrel Protocol to control the substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. But in 1995, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for this work along with Paul Krutzen and Mario Molina. I think that if anything, there's an argument to say that his advocacy actually cemented his scientific legacy that we know more about Sherry Rowling's scientific work today in part because of what he did as a public, as a responsible scientist. So is there a comparable position for climate scientists? Yes, absolutely. Greenhouse gases are causing climate change. Climate change is dangerous. As I say in the film, it threatens people's lives, it threatens our homes, our well-being, our prosperity, and it also threatens polar bears and many other species, coral reefs and others. So if we want to protect humans and other species from the damages of disruptive climate change, then we must dramatically reduce and eventually phase out greenhouse gas emissions. And this is a deductive consequence that follows logically from our scientific work. But, however, as natural scientists, we don't have the expertise to answer questions such as, which is better a carbon tax or emissions trading system. If we go for an emissions trading system, should it be revenue neutral? Sorry, if we go for carbon tax, should it be revenue neutral? And if so, should we do it through fee and dividend or through cutting tariffs and taxes elsewhere? And how useful are fee and tariffs in stimulating renewable energy production? Should we focus on grid integration or energy storage? And what about nuclear power? These are all matters of social science, law, policy, and politics."}, {"content": "It doesn't mean we can't have an opinion on these questions, of course, as citizens we can. And Jim Hansen has a right to be an advocate for the fee and dividend system if he wants to as a citizen. But I do think it's important for us to be clear about the limits of our own expertise because let's face it, we aren't the people, unless you have a pilot's license, we aren't the people to fly that plane. So I want to argue that we should be reticent about areas outside our expertise. We should respect the expertise of others who are expert in those domains, whether they're economists, psychologists, lawyers, or other natural scientists. And if we want to address these topics because we've concluded that they're essential to the solution, then we should forge collaborations with colleagues in those domains. Put another way, if we expect people to respect our expertise, then we also have to respect theirs. That seems like common sense. But we should not be reticent about talking about the things we know and understand, the things we know to be true. And we should not be reticent about calling out others who say things that we know to be untrue. Experience of the past several decades has shown that when it comes to facts about the natural world, there are many people prepared to speak against the facts for many diverse reasons. And therefore, someone has to speak for the facts. And that's someone, I think, is us."}, {"content": "Thank you very much. So, who's going to the science march? That was wonderful. If there are any questions, please ask them."}, {"content": "Yes. Just call on people. Yeah."}, {"content": "Oh. Oh, here we go."}, {"content": "Thank you. Is this on? Yes. Oh, boy. It's very on. So I'm a great admirer of your work. And I found your chain of logic persuasive this evening, but loses me at one point. You suggest, but never quite say, that if more climate scientists spoke out about climate change, it would make a difference. So to put it in question form, do you believe that in spite of evidence that Peter Froomehoff speaks out James McCarthy writes letters to the globe last week, Somerville, et cetera, et cetera. Any climate scientists are speaking out. It's not clear to me what difference that's making. Yeah, that's a fair question. Of course, with anything evolving, social change, these are very hard things to judge, what makes a difference, what moves the needle. But I think that if you think about it, I mean, you named four or five people and I could probably name four or five more. But there are something like 10,000 climate scientists in America. And when we think about the people who have spoken out, the same dozen names comes to mind all the time. And I've served on committees that give out prizes for climate science communication. And I can tell you that the lists of people that get nominated are distressingly small. So I think that actually the numbers of people who have really been involved making the effort are small compared to the pool of people who are potentially available to do the work. And I think it's very important to have a larger pool for a couple of reasons. One is that we know we do have good evidence from social science research about the so-called trusted messenger problem. People respond to messages in part based on who's telling it. And that makes it really important that it isn't just a couple of people. It isn't just Jim Hansen and Richard Somerville and Peter Fremhoff, much as I love all those people. No, I don't love Jim Hansen. No, just kidding. Not just I honor and respect all three of those men. We need more different people. And everyone talks about Catherine Haleho now because she's this famous evangelical Christian scientist. And it's absolutely fabulous what Catherine is doing. But I mean, she is so incredibly lonely. And she's not the only climate scientist in America who is a religious believer. So why are we always talking about Catherine Hale? I mean, where are the other Christian scientists, not Christian scientists, but scientists who are Christians? I mean, where are they, right? And we know we do have evidence from the evolution debate that it does make a difference. When students hear about, and the person doesn't even have to come to class, there was a great talk at Trippoliest just last month or whatever we were there. I don't know."}, {"content": "Time has stood still since Donald Trump got elected. But there was this great talk about an experiment that faculty at ASU have done where in class, in a biology class, they talk about scientists, evolutionary biologists who are also Christians like Ken Miller, Brown. And it doesn't, you don't need Ken to come to the class. Just talking about it, just having the students read something that he wrote about how he personally recognizes his religious faith with his scientific work. That makes a difference in how students receive the scientific information that they're getting. So we have evidence to say that it does make a difference. And so, and again, though, it's not just about writing a letter to the editor. I think the evidence also tells us that, no, I don't think writing more letters to the Boston Globe is the key thing right now. Oh, forgive me, but that is how I feel. But I think getting out, talking to people in communities, explaining to people how you became a climate scientist, what you've learned, and why it matters. Why it matters to people in the places they live. I think we do have evidence that that can make a difference. We also know that most people, when they vote, you know, they're not voting about, people didn't vote for Donald Trump because he said climate change was a hoax, right? And part of the problem is that people don't see climate change as a problem that affects them and their lives. So we need to do more to talk about what the relationship is between climate change and jobs and storms that do affect you or that affect your crops. And that's a message that I think has not been articulated nearly as fully as it needs to be. Yeah."}, {"content": "Oh, sorry, well, that's right. Okay, so it's alternate sides. I don't know who I'm talking to. Oh, hi. Yeah. I wonder if you could clarify something and just didn't focus quite for me."}, {"content": "And the most thing the last part of you talk. You said you distinguish science from the values and you said the people who are the deniers are really motivated by values. They associate their position with freedom and so on. Now are you saying that the scientists should get in a debate with them about values? You quickly outlined a few values like fairness and accountability and so on. But the scientists aren't expert about values necessarily. And besides which the deniers, it's not like they're... are leading with their values, they're denying the science. And that's something the scientists do know. So how much do you want the scientists to be talking about values and why? Yeah."}, {"content": "OK, that's a great question."}, {"content": "I think you're right, because this is tricky. So the point is, though, when climate change denires attack the science, and scientists then try to answer it with science, it doesn't work. Because first of all, now you're in a debate about the science. And that just, one of the claims of climate change denial is that the science is unsettling. There's a big debate. So if you participate in a debate, now they have won, because you've demonstrated that there's a debate. And we learned this again in the evolution situation, too. If an evolutionary biologist debates a creationist, the evolutionary biologist always loses. Because what the audience hears is, oh, there's a big debate. We don't really know. So the debate framework, when you're debating science, just doesn't work. So then the question is, well, what are some of the alternatives? And so what I'm trying to get at, and it is a little subtle, so maybe I didn't explain clearly, is to expose, to say, look, I understand that there's a value premise here, right? And I understand that you don't want to see the expansion of big government. So let's talk about how we could solve this with small government solutions. So it's a way of shifting the argument. And then I think a scientist can talk about values if they are your own values. Because we all have values. You don't have to be an expert on values to talk about your values. So one of the things I do sometimes is I do talk about accountability. And I say, look, most of us believe in accountability. So let's talk about who made this problem, and who's got the responsibility to fix it. Because one of the strategies that we've also seen being used is the idea that this is the fault of China or India, right? And so it's a way of saying, well, let's talk about the US contribution to climate change. We made this problem, but we also can fix it."}, {"content": "And we can fix it through technologically innovation. And then we can move the conversation into a discussion about grid integration and energy storage. And that moves the conversation where I want it. Because I don't want to be debating whether or not climate change is happening. I want to be debating how do we get better grid integration and energy storage. And then I've got the conversation where I want it to be. And then I can talk to my audience about all this cool stuff that's going on in the technological domain and all the jobs that have been created in green energy in this country, which it turns out almost nobody knows about. Here's a good question."}, {"content": "Again, my postdoc is not allowed to answer. But how many jobs do you think there are in coal in the United States? OK, most estimates say between 20 and 30,000. So this is a highly educated audience. And even you think it's much more than it is. Most people will tell you a million or 500,000, right? There are actually incredibly few jobs in coal mining in this country, despite all the fusing and rhetoric that we've been hearing about the one coal, right? How many jobs do we have now today, not in the future, but today in renewable energy? Anybody care to guess? 500,000? Do I? OK, this is a ridiculously educated audience."}, {"content": "This doesn't work as well. The correct answer, though, even in this wildly educated Harvard audience, 3.5 million. Yeah, who knows that?"}, {"content": "So that's the point. We want to be take, if people are worried about jobs, let's talk about jobs, because actually we have really good evidence on that job front. So does that kind of clarify it a bit?"}, {"content": "Good."}, {"content": "Thank you. Hi."}, {"content": "And I need to add something over here. I don't want this to get into a debate about religion, but I do have a point to make a question to ask. I'm actually from Texas. Don't worry, I'm on your side. And I'm a science advocate among my people. I just mentioned that. My family is chocked full of very religious people. My dad's a Southern Baptist minister. Most of the people in my family are in the ministry. And when I talk to them about this stuff, they don't deny the science. They deny that we'll be here long enough for it to matter. They keep telling me that don't worry, Jesus is coming. And so I wonder where the argument is, what the point we can make is, and if there's hope for even any progress with these kind of people. Yeah."}, {"content": "I don't think there's anything you can do, honestly. No, really."}, {"content": "I mean, I'm teaching science and religion in America, and one of the things that's so interesting about religious belief in America is how incredibly diverse it is. But if people are Millenarians who believe that Jesus is coming, that's all going in pretty soon anyway, I'm not really sure there's much of an argument you can make that would change those people's minds. So it might be better to just move on and work on, you know, I mean, Texas already has a feed and tariff for wind power. But to think about, you know, things you could do to support renewable energy that people might support for other reasons, like it's economically sensible, or some other issue that they might like. I don't know."}, {"content": "I'm sorry, what? I'm sorry. I know you're going to be a little bit more confused. Sorry. What was that?"}, {"content": "What? Do you think that the problem with religious belief is that we care to care to care to be back? We think that. Right. But if you think it's all about to end, right? I mean, if you really, and especially, no, but I mean, this does raise an important issue. I mean, one of the challenges that scientists often face is that things that for us are clearly evidence to support our theories are not necessarily evidence of that for other people. So if you have an eschatological philosophy, and you do believe that the world is about to end, then the intensification of hurricanes, you know, heating of the ocean, depth of coral reefs, things that for us are clearly evidence of climate disruption, for those people could be evidence that we're really getting close. So you can't really win that argument, right?"}, {"content": "And so you might just decide, you know, you need to move on, right? But the fact is, let's face it. I mean, political change doesn't come because everyone agrees on everything. Political change comes because enough people agree on enough things. And so I think that's where again, there are people who are evangelical Christians who might disagree with me on a whole heck of a lot of things, but still might be willing to support solar power because they could see the way in which it might empower their communities, right? Or they might see the way it could bring jobs to their communities. So yeah, yeah."}, {"content": "Oh, sorry, you're next. Okay, go ahead."}, {"content": "Hi. About a month ago, I went to Denver for three days of training with Al Gore's group, the Climate Reality Project. And as part of this free training, I've got an obligation to participate or be involved or organized 10 events during the year. Oh, gosh. As I was thinking about how to meet my obligations, one thing that occurred to me was to turn to my work. I work for a national company in healthcare. It's a billion dollar company. So I sent an email to the owner of the company and he said, oh, sure, let's talk about it. I had a conversation with him yesterday in which he said, well, you know, this is a really good thing, but I concerned about the political angle. Some of our customers and employees might not agree with the message. So as we talked over about half an hour, I was able to pull him around to thinking about this. This is a green initiative. We're doing something good. It's going to benefit people. So we take it out of the political angle. Well, today, Michael Mann gets into it with a Lamar Smith and with Judith Curry at the House Science Committee meetings and it's going to be in New York Times tomorrow and my boss is going to read that. So we've got this political environment going on that's making it difficult for people to take positions because they're afraid of the polarization. You're out there speaking. Catherine Heyho is. Michael Mann is. But where are the rest of the scientists? Well, I mean, that was the question we had earlier, right? And that is part of my argument is that I think that more people and more diverse people need to be involved in this issue. And the more different kinds of people are out there talking, the less this would look like, it would just be a particular political point of view. I mean, the hearing today was an interesting when I got approached by the committee last week. And this is theater, right? So we have to borrow from our colleagues in the theater department and think about how do you respond to a theatrical performance? And so when I'd recommend it, it was too late because they'd already invited Mike to come. And that's okay, Mike's great. But I said don't invite a scientist to respond, right? This is a charade, you know, I mean, it's ridiculous."}, {"content": "You can find three people say almost anything anywhere if you look hard enough. I think what you should do is just fill the chair with all the reports, you know, all the government reports, all the IPCC reports, just stack them and have a giant pile and say that's our response, right? You know, so, you know, we could begin to think creatively."}, {"content": "We don't have to just be pulled in all the time to these, you know, frameworks that we know are wrong and misleading. But we do get sucked into them and it's hard not to, right? It's hard not to think. I mean, it was an interesting moment for me when I realized the House Science Committee, well, the minority is calling me. And I'm telling them don't get a scientist to testify, you know, just bring in a pile of reports, right? And after I wrote, you know, I said that. I hung up the phone and thought, wow, that's an interesting moment, you know, right? So, but, I mean, we do have to be creative. We have to think differently about this, I think, than we have in the past. Okay, thank you. I'm actually related to what you just addressed. But so I'm a PhD student at this point without much public visibility or platform. And I'm just curious what you think are positive and productive venues for scientists to express their expertise to affect real change. Go to a local school, go talk in your church. I mean, we're all part of organizations and networks. And I think what you said about your job and your work is a really important insight. Sometimes we think we don't have access because we don't get invited to Congress so we don't get invited. But, you know, public opinion isn't really being made on the front page of the New York Times as much as the editors and New York Times would like to think that it is. Public opinion is being made by people talking to their friends and their neighbors and in their churches and in their synagogues and in their mosques and in their community groups. So there are opportunities to reach out to people all the time, but we sometimes don't see them because we take for granted what's around us. So I would say, you know, wherever you live, maybe the local library has a lecture series that you could volunteer to speak in. Or give me your phone number and I will tell them to invite you. And I mean, seriously, I get so many more invitations and I could possibly handle. And I'm always looking for other colleagues who I can suggest. So if you want to do talks, let me know. And I'll send, you know, I mean, obviously not everything I get invited to do, you know, they'll take a substitute, but some of those they will. But the point is they're all kinds of opportunities. And, you know, I was thinking about this the other day about being a Harvard professor and I'm going to South Dakota State tomorrow. You know, I think if most of us get invited to speak at Princeton or Chicago or Caltech, of course we go because we see the obvious value for our professional stature to do that. But I think that a lot of colleagues if they got invited to go to South Dakota State would just say no thanks, I'm busy, right? And my thinking about that is completely inverted now. I mean, I should say myself, 15 years ago, I would have probably thought that."}, {"content": "Now it's the other way around. I get invited to go to Princeton, I say, you guys don't need me, South Dakota State, they need me, right? So where I'm going to speak, what I'm accepting now is very different than even five years ago, because I'm really thinking in terms of places where outreach could make more of a difference. So I'm not doing any more teachers and teachers in Cambridge, I'm already told people that. Okay, so anyone's thinking about it, because I don't think this is where we need the action. And I think that all of us should be thinking about what are our points of connection to places where it could make a difference. And that, for a lot of us, means not on the Harvard campus, but it might be in our communities because lots of us live in places where, as I said, people might not be climate deniers, but they may not be very engaged in understanding why this issue is important. So let's just have two more questions, is that okay?"}, {"content": "Yeah, that'd be great, thank you. And then I'm sure, I know we would be happy to. Do what, go home and have a good night's sleep."}, {"content": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. There are other contexts in which scientists are asked to make moral choices. A couple of years ago, Steven Hawking refused to attend a major conference in Israel because he was asked to observe the academic boycott there. Should scientists take a moral stand on very pressing issues of the day, if it's not directly related to their field of inquiry, even though it entails moral obligation in which some of their activities may come in contact with the circumstances that are resulting in various forms of repression in human suffering. Look, I mean, I can't tell other people what to do."}, {"content": "I think those kinds of issues are quite difficult and vexed and people have to decide for themselves. But in general, my view would be, would be no. I do think that as climate scientists or as toxicologists, or as marine biologists, or whatever our field is, that we have a particular role to play as experts. I mean, that's why I use the cartoon about applying the plane. And that's what I'm really most interested in. Now, of course, as human beings, we're going to be making choices all the time about what we think are more or more, or we might make choices about our own safety. I mean, speaking of Texas, I've been to Texas more than once. But I do have reservations now about going back. Now that Texas and universities are allowing students to carry guns on campus. I mean, I find that very problematic and actually potentially a threat to my own personal safety. So I think that we might make choices. We might decide, in particular, situations that we might not go somewhere because it offends our personal sensibilities or because we think it threatens our safety. Or we might just feel that we just need to take a stand. But at the same time, there's always that question of who you're hurting, right? Because when I went to Houston, I guess it was a year or two ago, it was right around the time that the legislature was debating that thing about carrying guns on campus. And I actually almost didn't go. And of course, my colleagues there said the obvious thing, which is if you don't come, you'll hurt us, right? We want to hear you. We, our students need to hear you. So what good does it do if you don't come, right? So there's always that question about who are you impacting through your actions. So I think when you get out and when you talk to people and when you try to be, to listen and be empathetic and understand people's questions and answer them honestly and take people's questions seriously, that's almost always a good thing to do. When you say, I can't go here because of X or Y, I think that's much more complicated, much more fraught. I think that's a good thing."}, {"content": "All right, let's start. I'll turn it on. I can speak through the stuff. I know it's on the screen for you. No, I won't be able to go up. Listen to that now."}, {"content": "Okay, my name's Andrew Bergman. I'm a PhD student here in applied physics and a member of a new group called the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. And this question is something I'm experiencing, but I'll frame it in terms of the conversation about climate change. I think that sometimes what I notice, and it's sort of related to this question, but more explicitly about expertise within a very specific field. Even when you say someone is a climate scientist, that is a lot of different types of scientists working on a totally disparate set of issues. And sometimes when you go testify in Congress, you're talking about the general science of climate. But the specificity with which people like Oppenheimer and others really understood the nuclear physics they were working on, doesn't necessarily apply in the same sort of general way to climate scientists. And I support scientists who have sort of peripheral or solid understanding advocating. But when we want the specific sort of expertise driven, sort of as you said, like somebody who really is an expert has a very different platform which they can stand and speak, should we as a scientific community be more discerning and actually say like, when you decide to speak out as an expert, be clear about the specificity of your expertise. And don't show up to schools or Congress and say you're an expert just because you have a degree in physics. I mean, I don't think when my friends ask me, tell me about climate science, I say I really don't know. I'm trusting other scientists. And that's the reality."}, {"content": "This is a really important point."}, {"content": "Thank you for raising it. So one of the reasons why I've been thinking about this whole issue of approximate expertise is because it's actually essential if we're going to be able to refute merchants of doubt type claims, right? Because one of the ways that the whole doubt-mongering strategy works is to recruit scientists to be part of this, right? And that was a key strategy that the tobacco industry invented, which was to find scientists to come and speak. Now, in many cases, those people were actually scientists of some kind. They had some kind of scientific training, but they weren't oncologists. They weren't public health officials. They weren't physicians. And Fred Singer, who I talked about, is a classic case in point. I mean, the man was a very intelligent, very highly educated person, but he knew nothing about cancer or bronchitis or emphysema or epidemiology or any of the disciplines that could have been potentially relevant to that case. And that's the key point about what you're saying. So when it comes to climate science, there are many disciplines that are relevant. And there are many angles from which you might enter into the topic with legitimate strong expertise. Just as with tobacco, you could have been a physician. You could have been an epidemiologist. You could have been an oncologist. Many different expertise could have been relevant there. And Singer had none of them. So that should have been a red flag. It should have been a red flag to his colleagues. It should have been a red flag to the media. But it's not, in part, because we don't discern. And that is why I think it's so important that we are discerning and that we also exercise a certain amount of restraint. Right? And I work hard, really hard on this, because I get asked about all kinds of things. And you know, I have, I mean, just the other day, I got asked this question. I went and talked to the EPS graduate students and someone wanted to talk about immigration. And the first thing I said is, I, I, I, I, you know, no, I'm like, I feel like I know a lot of things and immigration isn't one of them. I don't feel like, you know, and I just said, let's talk about other things, right? So being able to say, it's not my area. I really don't know. If I answer that question, I just be giving you my personal opinion. I think that's really important."}, {"content": "Now that said, though, there is one other nuance to add to this. Expertise is not absolute, it's relative. So depending on the context, it might be that even though you're a physicist, you might actually be pretty knowledgeable about evolutionary biology. Maybe you've even read the origin of species. And if somebody asked you a question about it, you might be able to say, well, look, I'm not an evolutionary biologist, but I do know certain things. Or something I sometimes say when I'm asked, I'm not an economist, you know, but some of my best friends are economists. But my economist, my economics colleagues, say that carbon pricing is one of the most effective things we could do to level playing field and pay the true cost, not the price, but the cost of carbon. So you can invoke the authority of other experts that you know or that you've read. And then that invites your audience to say, okay, so if we want to learn more about this, you know, next year we invite an economist to come and speak to you. And you can even give them the names. You could say, well, I am friends with Nick Stern and here's what Nick says about it, right? And that's, I think, legitimate because you've talked to the person you've played attention to their arguments. One time years ago, when I was talking to a group of grad students, a student, and I forget, she was studying choral reefs. It was something to do with marine biology. And she said that she was in a choral group, a singing group, in which one of the other people in the group had asked her about climate change. And it was some element of climate change that was quite far away from what she worked on. And she said she felt really awkward because she felt like she wasn't an expert. But I said to her, you know, that's true. You're not an expert on, you know, tropospheric warming. But in that group, you are the local expert. And people are turning to you because they know that you're getting a PhD. This was at UC Davis. They know you're at Davis. They know Davis is a good school. And by asking you, they're actually saying that they trust you. They want to know what you know about this. And in that situation, I think it is reasonable to say, well, it's not my specialty, but here's what I know. And I think that, so expertise is contextual and relative. And it's about, in a way, it's just about being thoughtful about where your limits of expertise are and being honest about that. And when it goes too far to say, okay, I really can't answer that. I'm sorry. So, and on that note, I can't answer that. On that note. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}], "Naomi Oreskes: Why we should trust scientists": [{"content": "Every day we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information. Scientists tell us that the world is warming. Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe. But how do we know if they are right? Why should be believe the science? The fact is, many of us actually\ndon't believe the science. Public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportions of the American people don't believe the climate is\nwarming due to human activities, don't think that there is\nevolution by natural selection, and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines. So why should we believe the science? Well, scientists don't like talking about \nscience as a matter of belief. In fact, they would contrast science with faith, and they would say belief is the domain of faith. And faith is a separate thing\napart and distinct from science. Indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager. Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician who tried to bring scientific\nreasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in God, and his wager went like this: Well, if God doesn't exist but I decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost. Maybe a few hours on Sunday."}, {"content": "(Laughter) But if he does exist and I don't believe in him, then I'm in deep trouble. And so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God. Or as one of my college professors said, \"He clutched for the handrail of faith.\" He made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind. Now the fact is though, for most of us, most scientific claims are a leap of faith. We can't really judge scientific\nclaims for ourselves in most cases. And indeed this is actually\ntrue for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties. So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you whether a vaccine is safe. Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory. A physicist cannot tell you, despite the claims of some of them, whether or not tobacco causes cancer. So, if even scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own fields, then why do they accept the\nclaims of other scientists? Why do they believe each other's claims? And should we believe those claims? So what I'd like to argue is yes, we should, but not for the reason that most of us think. Most of us were taught in school\nthat the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method. We were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims. The method that most of us were taught in school, we can call it the textbook method, is the hypothetical deductive method. According to the standard\nmodel, the textbook model, scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses, and then they go out into the world and they say, \"Okay, well are those consequences true?\" Can we observe them taking\nplace in the natural world? And if they are true, then the scientists say, \"Great, we know the hypothesis is correct.\" So there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this. One of the most famous examples comes from the work of Albert Einstein. When Einstein developed the\ntheory of general relativity, one of the consequences of his theory was that space-time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric. And that that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun. So if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it. That was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to test it but they did test it in 1919, and lo and behold it turned out to be true. Starlight actually does bend\nas it travels around the sun. This was a huge confirmation of the theory."}, {"content": "It was considered proof of the truth of this radical new idea, and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe. Now, sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the deductive-nomological model, mainly because academics like \nto make things complicated. But also because in the ideal case, it's about laws. So nomological means having to do with laws. And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea: ideally, it is a law of nature. Why does it matter that it is a law of nature? Because if it is a law, it can't be broken. If it's a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are. And all of you know of at least\none example of a famous law: Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2, which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass. And that relationship is true no matter what."}, {"content": "Now, it turns out, though, that there \nare several problems with this model. The main problem is that it's wrong."}, {"content": "It's just not true. (Laughter) And I'm going to talk about\nthree reasons why it's wrong. So the first reason is a logical reason."}, {"content": "It's the problem of the fallacy\nof affirming the consequent. So that's another fancy, academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions. So just because the prediction comes true doesn't actually logically\nprove that the theory is correct. And I have a good example of that too, \nagain from the history of science. This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe with the Earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it. The Ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries. Well, why? Well the answer is because it made \nlots of predictions that came true. The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions\nof the motions of the planet, in fact more accurate predictions at first than the Copernican theory\nwhich we now would say is true. So that's one problem with the textbook model."}, {"content": "A second problem is a practical problem, and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even\nbe aware that they're making. So an important example of this comes from the Copernican model, which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system. So when Nicolaus Copernicus said, actually the Earth is not the center of the universe, the sun is the center of the solar system, the Earth moves around the sun. Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the Earth around the sun. And so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallax. And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius -- well I know I'm in Manhattan\nso you guys can't see the stars, but imagine you're out in the country, \nimagine you chose that rural life \u2014 and we look at a star in December, we see that star against the backdrop of distant stars. If we now make the same observation six months later when the Earth has moved to this position in June, we look at that same star and we \nsee it against a different backdrop. That difference, that angular\ndifference, is the stellar parallax. So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes. Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing, nothing at all. And many people argued that this proved \nthat the Copernican model was false. So what happened? Well, in hindsight we can say \nthat astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which we would now say were incorrect. The first was an assumption \nabout the size of the Earth's orbit. Astronomers were assuming \nthat the Earth's orbit was large relative to the distance to the stars. Today we would draw the picture more like this, this comes from NASA, and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small. In fact, it's actually much\nsmaller even than shown here. The stellar parallax therefore, is very small and actually very hard to detect. And that leads to the second reason why the prediction didn't work, because scientists were also assuming that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallax. And that turned out not to be true. It wasn't until the 19th century that scientists were able to detect the stellar parallax. So, there's a third problem as well. The third problem is simply a factual problem, that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model. A lot of science isn't deductive at all, it's actually inductive. And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily start with theories and hypotheses, often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world. And the most famous example\nof that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin. When Darwin went out as a young \nman on the voyage of the Beagle, he didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory. He just knew that he wanted\nto have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data. Mainly he knew that he hated medicine because the sight of blood made him sick so he had to have an alternative career path. So he started collecting data. And he collected many things, \nincluding his famous finches. When he collected these finches,\nhe threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant. Many years later back in London, Darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation, and that explanation was the\ntheory of natural selection. Besides inductive science, scientists also often participate in modeling. One of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things. And how do we do that? Well, one way you can do it is to build a model that tests an idea. So this is a picture of Henry Cadell, who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century."}, {"content": "You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots. (Laughter) And Cadell wanted to answer the question, how are mountains formed? And one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains\nlike the Appalachians, you often find that the rocks in them are folded, and they're folded in a particular way, which suggested to him that they were actually being\ncompressed from the side. And this idea would later play a major role in discussions of continental drift. So he built this model, this crazy contraption with levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow, buckets, a big sledgehammer. I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots. Maybe it's going to rain. And he created this physical model in order to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud, that looked a lot like mountains if you compressed them from the side. So it was an argument about\nthe cause of mountains. Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside, so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations. But a computer simulation is a kind of a model. It's a model that's made with mathematics, and like the physical models of the 19th century, it's very important for thinking about causes. So one of the big questions\nto do with climate change, we have tremendous amounts of evidence that the Earth is warming up. This slide here, the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last 150 years showing that the Earth's temperature has steadily increased, and you can see in particular\nthat in the last 50 years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade, or almost two degrees Fahrenheit. So what, though, is driving that change? How can we know what's causing the observed warming? Well, scientists can model it using a computer simulation. So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the Earth's climate, so sulfate particles from air pollution, volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions, changes in solar radiation, and, of course, greenhouse gases. And they asked the question, what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life? So here is the real life in black. Here's the model in this light gray, and the answer is a model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT, all of the above. The only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurements is with all of these things put together, including greenhouse gases, and in particular you can see that the increase in greenhouse gases tracks this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last 50 years. And so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that\nclimate change is happening, we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason why. So now because there all these different things that scientists do, the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said, \"The only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes.\" Now this quotation has often\nbeen taken out of context, because Feyerabend was not actually saying that in science anything goes. What he was saying was, actually the full quotation is, \"If you press me to say what is the method of science, I would have to say: anything goes.\" What he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things. Scientists are creative. But then this pushes the question back: If scientists don't use a single method, then how do they decide what's right and what's wrong? And who judges? And the answer is, scientists judge, and they judge by judging evidence. Scientists collect evidence in many different ways, but however they collect it, they have to subject it to scrutiny. And this led the sociologist Robert Merton to focus on this question of how scientists scrutinize data and evidence, and he said they do it in a way he called \"organized skepticism.\" And by that he meant it's organized because they do it collectively, they do it as a group, and skepticism, because they do it from a position of distrust. That is to say, the burden of proof is on the person with a novel claim. And in this sense, science\nis intrinsically conservative. It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say, \"Yes, we know something, this is true.\" So despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts, what we find is that actually, really major changes in scientific thinking are relatively rare in the history of science. So finally that brings us to one more idea: If scientists judge evidence collectively, this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus, and to say that at the end of the day, what science is, what scientific knowledge is, is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny, collective scrutiny, have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it, either yea or nay. So we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts. We can also think of science as being a kind of a jury, except it's a very special kind of jury. It's not a jury of your peers, it's a jury of geeks. It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s, and unlike a conventional jury, which has only two choices, guilty or not guilty, the scientific jury actually has a number of choices. Scientists can say yes, something's true. Scientists can say no, it's false. Or, they can say, well it might be true but we need to work more\nand collect more evidence. Or, they can say it might be true, but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later. That's what scientists call \"intractable.\" But this leads us to one final problem: If science is what scientists say it is, then isn't that just an appeal to authority? And weren't we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy? Well, here's the paradox of modern science, the paradox of the conclusion I think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to, that actually science is the appeal to authority, but it's not the authority of the individual, no matter how smart that individual is, like Plato or Socrates or Einstein. It's the authority of the collective community. You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd, but a very special kind of crowd. Science does appeal to authority, but it's not based on any individual, no matter how smart that individual may be. It's based on the collective wisdom, the collective knowledge, the collective work, of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem. Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust, this \"show me\" culture, illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence. Of course, these people don't\nreally look like scientists, because they're much too happy. (Laughter) Okay, so that brings me to my final point."}, {"content": "Most of us get up in the morning. Most of us trust our cars. Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan, this is a bad analogy, but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan get up in the morning and get in their cars and turn on that ignition, and their cars work, and they work incredibly well. The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down. So why is that? Why do cars work so well? It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk. It's because the modern automobile is the product of more than 100 years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people. The modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car, and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort. We benefit not just from the genius of Benz and Ford and Musk but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car. And the same is true of science, only science is even older. Our basis for trust in science is actually the same as our basis in trust in technology, and the same as our basis for trust in anything, namely, experience. But it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have blind trust in anything. Our trust in science, like science itself, should be based on evidence, and that means that scientists have to become better communicators. They have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it, and it means that we have\nto become better listeners. Thank you very much."}, {"content": "(Applause)"}]}
