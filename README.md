# Continuous Active Learning (CAL)

**Continuous Active Learning (CAL)** is a revolutionary, minimalist and scalable educational platform designed to promote cheat-free, active learning. It ensures that students genuinely engage with course material, validating their understanding and discouraging dishonest practices through AI-driven proctoring and progressive content unlocking.

---

## Features
### Core Functionalities
- **Active Participation**: Tracks student presence and activity during learning sessions.
- **Contextual Assessments**: Injects questions during video playback to validate understanding.
- **AI-Enhanced Features**:
  - AI-based proctoring to monitor activity and ensure integrity.
  - Question generation using LLMs and human validation.
- **Cheat-Free Progression**:
  - Sequential unlocking of content based on mastery.
  - Strict anti-cheating measures during assignments and exams.

### AI Proctoring Capabilities
1. **Multiple People Detection**: Ensures only one student is present and prevents external interference or help.
2. **Focus Detection**: Verifies if the student is paying attention to the screen.
3. **Background Blur Detection**: Detects software-based background replacement to ensure an authentic environment.
4. **Voice Activity Detection**: Monitors audio to ensure students are not speaking to others during study sessions. (Language agnostic.)
5. **Hand Raise Detection**: Randomly prompts students to raise their hand, ensuring they are not using a virtual camera or other deceptive tools.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
To set up the development environment, the following tools are required:
- **Docker**: For containerized development and deployment.
- **VSCode**: For IDE-based development and DevContainer support.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudarshansudarshan/cal.git
   cd cal
   ```

2. **Set Up Dev Containers**
   - Open the repository in VSCode with Docker enabled.
   - Select the relevant DevContainer configuration based on the `.devcontainer` folder.

3. **Run Backend Services by opening the Dev Containers**
   - For LMS Engine:
     ```bash
     cd backend/lms_engine
     ```
     
   - For Activity Engine:
     ```bash
     cd backend/activity_engine
     ```
     
   - For AI Engine:
     ```bash
     cd backend/ai_engine
     ```

4. **Run the Frontend**
   - Navigate to `frontend-cal` and start the React app:
     ```bash
     cd frontend-cal
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
